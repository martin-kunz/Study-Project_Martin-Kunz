# <ins>NER Robustness for Out of Domain Data</ins>

### <ins>Introduction</ins>
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a vast and active field of research within Natural Language Processing (NLP) that deals with the identification and classification of key information in texts. This key information typically includes names of people, organizations, places, time and numerical values such as amounts of money and percentages. NER serves as an important building block for a variety of NLP applications, including information retrieval, question-answering systems, sentiment analysis, content summarization and automatic translation.
However, there are often problems with the training and evaluation of NER models. Many models are trained and tested on the same data sets on which they were developed. As a result, the models deliver very good results within their domain, but often perform worse on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, meaning data outside their domain, for example, if a NER model is trained on the CoNLL-2003 dataset and also evaluated on test data from this data, it delivers very good results. However, if we now use test data from the SEC dataset, for example, and evaluate it on our model trained on CoNLL-2003, we get much poorer results.
The goal of this research is to modify the last linear layer of our model, which is responsible for the final prediction of the individual entities, using different initialization techniques. Different modification techniques will be applied and evaluated in order to generate the best possible results for OOD datasets.

### <ins>Scripts</ins>
- ```masking.py``` - Replaces tokens in a data set that are tagged with certain NER tags with a placeholder (`[MASK]`). This script creates a masked output for each tag for the test, train and validation datasets.
- ```data_preprocessing.py``` - Contains functions for preparing data for NER tasks. The script tokenizes texts, matches NER tags to tokens and provides methods to replace specific tags with masks. Predictions for masked tokens can also be extracted.
- ```topk_predictions.py``` - Calculates the top-k predictions for masked tokens in a text. The script uses the XLM-RoBERTa model to generate predictions for masked sentences in the training, validation and test datasets.
- ```combine.py``` - This script combines prediction data from multiple tag-specific text files into a single TSV file. It creates a structured output with columns for different tags such as ```I-PER```, ```B-LOC``` etc. and is designed for the train, test and validation data sets.
- ```get_top_predictions.py``` - Extracts the most frequent predictions for NER tags from several files and creates a cleaned output containing the best predictions for each tag.
- ```top_ner_predictions.py``` - Counts the most frequent first predictions for masked tokens from a CSV file and saves the results as a text file. The output contains the prediction, its frequency and the percentage.
- ```topk_predictions.py``` - Calculates the top-k predictions for masked tokens in a text. The script uses the XLM-RoBERTa model to generate predictions for masked sentences in the training, validation and test datasets.
- ```train_xlmroberta.py``` - Trains an XLM-RoBERTa model for NER tasks with the CoNLL03 dataset. It defines training arguments, processes the data and saves the trained model as well as checkpoints and logs.
- ```replace_prediction_head.py``` - Replaces the classification head of an XLM-RoBERTa model so that it provides static predictions for each tag. This is used to analyze the model parameters and the influence of specific initializations.
- ```eval.py``` - Evaluates a trained NER model using the CoNLL03 dataset. It calculates metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score and Accuracy. The script uses the `Trainer` of HuggingFace for the evaluation and saves the results in a log file.
