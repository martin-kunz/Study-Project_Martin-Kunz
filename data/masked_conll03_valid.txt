CRICKET - LEICESTERSHIRE TAKE OVER AT TOP AFTER INNINGS VICTORY .
<mask> 1996-08-30
West <mask> all-rounder Phil <mask> took four for 38 on Friday as Leicestershire beat Somerset by an innings and 39 runs in two days to take over at the head of the county championship .
Their stay on top , though , may be short-lived as title rivals Essex , Derbyshire and Surrey all closed in on victory while Kent made up for lost time in their rain-affected match against Nottinghamshire .
After bowling Somerset out for 83 on the opening morning at <mask> <mask> , Leicestershire extended their first innings by 94 runs before being bowled out for 296 with <mask> discard Andy <mask> taking three for 83 .
Trailing by 213 , Somerset got a solid start to their second innings before Simmons stepped in to bundle them out for 174 .
Essex , however , look certain to regain their top spot after Nasser <mask> and Peter <mask> gave them a firm grip on their match against Yorkshire at <mask> .
Hussain , considered surplus to <mask> 's one-day requirements , struck 158 , his first championship century of the season , as Essex reached 372 and took a first innings lead of 82 .
By the close Yorkshire had turned that into a 37-run advantage but off-spinner Such had scuttled their hopes , taking four for 24 in 48 balls and leaving them hanging on 119 for five and praying for rain .
At the <mask> , Surrey captain Chris <mask> , another man dumped by <mask> , continued to silence his critics as he followed his four for 45 on Thursday with 80 not out on Friday in the match against Warwickshire .
He was well backed by <mask> hopeful Mark <mask> who made 70 as Surrey closed on 429 for seven , a lead of 234 .
Derbyshire kept up the hunt for their first championship title since 1936 by reducing Worcestershire to 133 for five in their second innings , still 100 runs away from avoiding an innings defeat .
Australian Tom <mask> took six for 82 but Chris <mask> , 123 , and Tim <mask> , 109 , took Derbyshire to 471 and a first innings lead of 233 .
After the frustration of seeing the opening day of their match badly affected by the weather , Kent stepped up a gear to dismiss Nottinghamshire for 214 .
They were held up by a gritty 84 from Paul <mask> but ex-England fast bowler Martin <mask> took four for 55 .
By stumps Kent had reached 108 for three .

SOCCER - SHEARER NAMED AS <mask> CAPTAIN .
<mask> 1996-08-30
The world 's costliest footballer Alan <mask> was named as the new <mask> captain on Friday .
The 26-year-old , who joined Newcastle for 15 million pounds sterling ( $ 23.4 million ) , takes over from Tony <mask> , who led the side during the European championship in June , and former captain David <mask> .
Adams and Platt are both injured and will miss <mask> 's opening World <mask> qualifier against <mask> on Sunday .
Shearer takes the captaincy on a trial basis , but new coach Glenn <mask> said he saw no reason why the former Blackburn and Southampton skipper should not make the post his own .
" I 'm sure there wo n't be a problem , I 'm sure Alan is the man for the job , " Hoddle said .
" There were three or four people who could have done it but when I spoke to Alan he was up for it and really wanted it .
" In four days it 's very difficult to come to a 100 percent conclusion about something like this ...
but he knows how to conduct himself , his team mates respect him and he knows about the team situation even though he plays up front . "
Shearer 's Euro <mask> striking partner Teddy <mask> withdrew from the squad with an injury on Friday .
He will probably be replaced by Shearer 's Newcastle team mate Les <mask> .

SOCCER - ROTOR FANS LOCKED OUT AFTER <mask> VIOLENCE .
<mask> 1996-08-30
Rotor <mask> must play their next home game behind closed doors after fans hurled bottles and stones at Dynamo <mask> players during a 1-0 home defeat on Saturday that ended Rotor 's brief spell as league leaders .
The head of the Russian league 's disciplinary committee , Anatoly <mask> , said on Friday that Rotor would play Lada <mask> to empty stands on September 3 .
The club , who put Manchester <mask> out of last year 's UEFA <mask> , were fined $ 1,000 .
Despite the defeat , Rotor are well placed with 11 games to play in the championship .
Lying three points behind Alania and two behind Dynamo <mask> , the <mask> side have a game in hand over the leaders and two over the <mask> club .
BOXING - <mask> 'S ROBERTO <mask> FIGHTS THE SANDS OF TIME .
<mask> <mask> 1996-08-30
Panamanian boxing legend Roberto <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> climbs into the ring on Saturday in another age-defying attempt to sustain his long career .
Duran , 45 , takes on little-known Mexican Ariel <mask> , 30 , in a super middleweight non-title bout in <mask> <mask> .
The fight , Duran 's first on home soil for 10 years , is being billed here as the " Return <mask> <mask> <mask> " and Duran still talks as if he was in his prime .
" I want a fifth title .
This match is to prepare me .
I feel good .
I 'm not retiring , " Duran told Reuters .
But those close to the boxer acknowledge that the man who has won championships in four different weight classes -- lightweight , welterweight , junior middleweight and middleweight -- is drawing close to the end of his career .
" Each time he fights , he 's on the last frontier of his career .
If he loses Saturday , it could devalue his position as one of the world 's great boxers , " Panamanian Boxing <mask> President Ramon <mask> said .
Duran , whose 97-12 record spans three decades , hopes a win in the 10-round bout will earn him a rematch against <mask> <mask> 's Hector <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> .
Camacho took a controversial points decision against the Panamanian in <mask> <mask> in June in a title fight .

TENNIS - TARANGO , O'BRIEN SPRING TWIN UPSETS UNDER THE LIGHTS .
Larry <mask>
<mask> <mask> 1996-08-30
Andre <mask> escaped disaster on Thursday but Wimbledon finalist MaliVai <mask> and Marcelo <mask> were not so fortunate on a night of upsets at the U.S. <mask> .
The 11th-seeded Washington fell short of reprising his Wimbledon miracle comeback as he lost to red-hot wildcard Alex <mask> 6-3 6-4 5-7 3-6 6-3 in a two hour 51 minute struggle on the Stadium court .
Next door on the grandstand , 10th seed Rios lost to another player with a Wimbledon connection -- bad boy Jeff <mask> .
The temperamental left-hander defeated the Chilean 6-4 4-6 7-6 6-2 .
The day programme went smoothly although sixth-seeded former champion Agassi had to wriggle out of a dangerous 3-6 0-4 hole , winning 18 of the last 19 games against <mask> 's Leander <mask> .
But the night belonged to the upstarts .
Washington , who climbed back from a 1-5 deficit , two sets down in the third set against Todd <mask> in the Wimbledon semifinals , looked poised for another sensational comeback .
O'Brien , a winner two weeks ago in <mask> <mask> for his first pro title , served for the match at 5-4 in the third set before Washington came charging back .
" I just kept saying to myself , ' keep giving yourself the best chance to win , keep battling , maybe something will happen , ' " said the 26-year-old O'Brien , ranked 65th .
" I kept my composure and I was proud of myself for that -- usually I would have folded up the tent and gone home . "
The hard-serving O'Brien , a former <mask> collegiate national champion , fired up 17 aces to ultimately subdue the never-say-die Washington .
The fifth set stayed on serve until the sixth game , when Washington , after saving one break point with a forehand winner down the line , netted a backhand to give O'Brien a 4-2 lead .
The Texan blasted in two aces to hold serve at 5-2 and then converted his eighth match point for victory when Washington found the net with another backhand from 40-0 .
" You just kind of keep fighting and you keep trying to make him play a little bit .
I think he got a little tight at a couple of moments , " said Washington . "
But I think he served pretty well when he had to . "
Tarango , whose Wimbledon tantrum two years ago brought him a $ 28,000 fine and suspension from this year 's tournament at the All-England <mask> , argued calls and taunted fans in his lively two hour , 24 minute tango with Rios on the grandstand .
A boisterous cheering section backed the distracted Chilean and booed the lanky American , who ate up all the attention .
" I 'm an emotional player , " said the 104th-ranked Tarango . "
I think I played very well tonight , very focused . "
The match turned on the third-set tiebreaker , which the American won 7-5 much to the dismay of the spectators .
" I love the crowd if they boo me every day .
It fires me up , makes me play my best tennis , " Tarango said .
" I played some of my best tennis in college when fraternities were throwing beer on me .
If tennis was like that every day , I think everybody wold be having a lot more fun . "
Rios did not appreciate Tarango 's antics .
" He 's always complaining too much , " said Rios . "
But I think it 's not that .
I think I played really bad .
It was tough to play at night .
Balls were going really fast .
I lost too many points that I never lose .
I did n't play my tennis . "
" I do n't see the ball like I see during the day .
I play an American so that 's why I play at night .
I did n't feel good on the court . "
At the end of the match , Tarango blew sarcastic kisses to the crowd , then jiggled his body to a Rios rooting section in a jeering salute .
" I support their enthusiasm , " Tarango said about the fans . "
At the same time , they 're cheering blatantly against me .
After I won I figured I could give them a little razzle-dazzle . "
NFL AMERICAN <mask> CUNNINGHAM RETIRES .
<mask> 1996-08-29
Randall <mask> , the National <mask> <mask> 's all-time leading rusher as a quarterback and one of the most athletic players ever to line up over centre , retired Thursday .
Cunningham played his entire 11-year career with the Philadelphia <mask> .
A three-time Pro <mask> selection , Cunningham rushed for 4,482 yards on 677 carries .
" I would like to thank the Eagles organisation and the wonderful fans of Philadelphia for supporting me throughout my career , " Cunningham said .
" Although it saddens me to leave , I am looking forward to spending more time with my family and pursuing other interests that have been on the back burner for sometime . "
" Randall was one of the most exciting quarterbacks in NFL history , " said Eagles owner Jeffrey <mask> . "
During his 11 years in <mask> , Randall was the cornerstone of the Eagles ' franchise and brought many great moments to fans in <mask> as well as across the NFL . "
A second-round choice in 1985 , Cunningham completed 1,874-of-3,362 passes ( 55.7 percent ) for 22,877 yards and 150 touchdowns .
Cunningham has already been signed as a broadcaster .

GOLF - HENKE TAKES LEAD IN <mask> , WOODS MAKES PRO DEBUT .
<mask> , <mask> 1996-08-29
Nolan <mask> fired a nine-under-par 62 to grab a two-shot lead after the opening round of the $ 1.2 million Greater <mask> <mask> Thursday as 20-year-old Tiger <mask> shot 67 in his professional debut .
Henke stood two strokes ahead of Bob <mask> and three up on Billy <mask> , Duffy <mask> and Jesper <mask> .
Woods , who turned pro Tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive U.S. <mask> <mask> , almost eagled the 18th hole .
He settled for a birdie and a four-under opening round that left him five shots off the pace .
" Yesterday was the toughest day I 've had for a long time , " Woods said . "
Today , I got to play golf . "
He added : " I thought I got off off to a great start .
It was a perfect start .
I 'm in a good position . "
Henke , who called his round a " pleasant surprise , " finished with six birdies on the final eight holes .
" We finally got things going in the right direction , " he said . "
It was my best round in a very long time .
My short game has improved since I 've had to use it so often .
That 's always been the worst part of my game .
All in all , playing bad 's been a good experience . "
Henke , who came within one shot of the course record set by Andrew <mask> during Wednesday 's pro-am , has three career PGA <mask> victories , but none since the 1993 BellSouth <mask> .
Estes , whose only win came at the 1994 Texas <mask> and whose best finish this year was a third-place tie at the Nortel <mask> in January , eagled the par-five fourth hole and added five birdies to grab sole possession of second place .
" No bogeys on the card , " he noted . "
Sometimes I take more pride in that . "
Woods was among a group of 13 players at four under , including 1993 champion Billy <mask> , who tied for second at last week 's World <mask> <mask> <mask> , and former U.S. <mask> champ Payne <mask> .
Defending champion Scott <mask> shot a three-under 68 and was six strokes back .
Phil <mask> , the only four-time winner on the PGA <mask> , skipped the tournament after winning the World <mask> <mask> <mask> last week .
Mark <mask> , Tom <mask> and Mark <mask> , who make up the rest of the top four on the money list , also took the week off .
SOCCER - SILVA 'S `LOST PASSPORT ' EXCUSE NOT ENOUGH FOR FIFA .
<mask> 1996-08-30
Spanish first division team Deportivo <mask> will be without key midfielder Mauro <mask> for Saturday 's game with Real <mask> after FIFA , soccer 's world governing body , suspended the Brazilian for one game for missing his national side 's European tour .
Silva excused his absence from <mask> 's game against <mask> , on Wednesday , and Saturday 's match with the <mask> by saying he had lost his passport .
But that did not prevent him from collecting the one-match suspension .
ATHLETICS - MITCHELL DEFEATS BAILEY IN FRONT OF FORMER CHAMPIONS .
Adrian <mask>
<mask> 1996-08-30
American Dennis <mask> outclassed Olympic 100 metres champion Donovan <mask> for the third time at a major post-Games meeting in front of the most experienced sprinting crowd in the world on Friday .
Watched by an array of former Olympic sprint champions at the <mask> grand prix meeting , Mitchell made a brilliant start in the 100 metres and held off Bailey 's strong finish to win in 10.08 seconds despite cool conditions .
Bailey , who set a world record of 9.84 on his way to victory in <mask> , could not catch his American rival and had to settle for third in a tight finish .
<mask> 's Michael <mask> was second with 10.09 with Bailey finishing in 10.13 .
Last Friday Mitchell , who finished fourth at the Atlanta <mask> , upstaged a trio of Olympic champions including Bailey to win the 100 in <mask> .
Earlier this month he also beat world champion Bailey in <mask> .

<mask> 1996-08-30
UEFA came down heavily on Belgian club Standard <mask> on Friday for " disgraceful behaviour " in an Intertoto final match against Karlsruhe of <mask> .
The Belgian club were fined 25,000 Swiss francs ( $ 20,850 ) for unsporting conduct and captain Guy <mask> banned for seven games .
He was sent off for insulting the referee and then urged his team mates to protest .
Roberto <mask> will be sidelined for six Euro ties after pushing the referee in the back as he protested about a Karlsruhe goal , while Didier <mask> was banned for four matches for a verbal attack soon after Bisconti was also dismissed .
Karlsruhe won the August 20 match 3-1 thanks to two late goals .
They took the tie 3-2 on aggregate and qualified for the UEFA <mask> .
ATHLETICS - HARRISON , EDWARDS TO MEET IN <mask> .
<mask> <mask> 1996-08-30
Olympic champion Kenny <mask> and world record holder Jonathan <mask> will both take part in a triple jump competition at the Solidarity <mask> <mask> <mask> on September 9 .
The International <mask> <mask> <mask> said on Friday that a schedule reshuffle had allowed organisers to hold a men 's triple jump as well as the women 's long jump on the " one usable runway at the war-devastated " <mask> stadium .
Atlanta <mask> silver medal winner Edwards has called on other leading athletes to take part in the <mask> meeting -- a goodwill gesture towards <mask> as it recovers from the war in the <mask> -- two days after the grand prix final in <mask> .
Edwards was quoted as saying : " What type of character do we show by going to the IAAF <mask> <mask> <mask> in <mask> where there is a lot of money to make but refusing to make the trip to <mask> as a humanitarian gesture ? "
SOCCER - BARATELLI TO COACH NICE .
<mask> , <mask> 1996-08-30
Former international goalkeeper Dominique <mask> is to coach struggling French first division side Nice , the club said on Friday .
Baratelli , who played for Nice and Paris <mask> <mask> , takes over from Albert <mask> who was fired on Thursday after Nice 's home defeat to Guingamp 2-1 in the league .
Nice have been unable to win any of their four league matches played this season and are lying a lowly 18th in the table .
SOCCER - MILAN 'S LENTINI MOVES TO ATALANTA .
<mask> 1996-08-30
Former Italian international winger Gianluigi <mask> , transferred to Milan in 1992 for what was believed to be a world record sum , has been loaned to serie <mask> club Atalanta for a year , newspapers reported on Friday .
The Gazzetta <mask> <mask> said the deal would cost Atalanta around $ 600,000 .
Lentini , 27 , joined Milan from Torino in a $ 12 million deal that many have speculated involved far more money changing hands and which has subsequently been investigated by magistrates for alleged financial irregularities .
The player suffered severe head injuries in a near-fatal car crash the following year and has since struggled to regain the form that made him a hero in <mask> .
The move to Bergamo-based Atalanta reunites Lentini , who fell out with ex-Milan coach Fabio <mask> last season , with his former coach at Torino , Emiliano <mask> .

<mask> COMELF H1 PROFIT RISE BELOW TARGET .
<mask> 1996-08-30
Romanian listed state engineer Comelf said it almost doubled six-month output , with net profit rising by 33 percent to 1.069 billion lei .
But the company complained inflation and the artificially high rate of the leu cut profit margins on exports , keeping profits well below its forecast of 1.4 billion lei .
Comelf 's six-month output rose to 4,378 tonnes of equipment from 2,684 tonnes in the equivalent period in 1995 , the company report to the <mask> stock exchange showed .
Comelf , based in the central Transylvanian town of <mask> , manufactures water purification equipment , machinery for the thermal power sector and other equipment .
" In the first six months of 1996 we concentrated on increasing the volume of our output and exports in particular and improving the quality of our products , " the report said .
From January to June Comelf exported 59 percent of its output , up from 37.3 percent in the same period last year .
The company said higher than anticipated inflation and rising raw materials and wage costs also hit profits .
Year-on-year inflation , initially estimated at 20 percent in December , was 33.8 percent in June , higher than a revised end-year forecast of 30 percent .
The 12 month figure quickened to 40.3 percent in July .
The leu currency has slipped only gradually this year , and is currently quoted at an official rate of 3,162 to the dollar , well below the 3,550 retail price that exporters say is more realistic .

NYMEX heating oil near session lows in pre-close .
<mask> <mask> 1996-08-30
NYMEX refined product prices lingered at session lows amid slim volume before the close while crude experienced lackluster buying ahead of the <mask> Labor <mask> weekend , traders said .
" There was some profit-taking early on , and it 's just sitting there , " a <mask> trader said of heating oil 's and gasoline 's losses .
September heating oil stood 1.02 cents lower at 62.65 cents a gallon .
Heat hit a session low of 62.45 shortly before the close .
September gasoline stood 0.87 cent lower at 62.85 cents a gallon .
Friday 's low in September gasoline was 62.75 .
Traders also said players were selling refined products in favor of crude ahead of the front month 's Friday expiry in the refined products .
The October heating oil-to-crude crack spread narrowed to $ 4.22 a barrel from Thursday 's $ 4.58 while the October gasoline-to-crude spread narrowed to $ 3.60 from Thursday 's $ 3.86 a barrel .
October crude stood eight cents higher at $ 22.23 barrel .
Buying interest in crude did not have enough conviction to send it much higher since many players had left early to start the Labor <mask> holiday weekend , traders said .
NYMEX will be closed Monday due to Labor <mask> .

<mask> debt futures end lower , shaken by <mask> NAPM .
<mask> 1996-08-30
<mask> debt futures finished a shortened pre-holiday session sharply lower , as the markets were shaken by a stronger than expected rise in the August National <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> ( NAPM ) index for the <mask> area , traders and analysts said .
The August <mask> NAPM rose 8.8 points to 60.0 , its highest level since 62.6 in February 1995 and the largest monthly rise since December 1993 .
Primary dealers immediately sold Eurodollar and bond futures , after the market on average was expecting the index to rise marginally to 51.9 from July 's 51.2 .
Traders also said Japanese investors were unwinding long Eurodollar futures / short swaps , and that heavy put buying helped pressure Eurodollars to lower levels before the close .
One <mask> firm bought 35,000 September 97 mid-curve put options at a strike price of 93.25 to 93.30 in the last two sessions , while a French firm bought 4,000 September 93.30 to 93.32 put spreads .
" Even before the data came out , we were seeing put buying , " one floor trader said .
Meanwhile , funds were reportedly good sellers of five-year notes .
Rumors circulated that the Federal <mask> was buying five-year notes , and that a renowned hedge fund manager was buying 10-year notes in the cash markets .
However , December T-bonds ended below a major trendline level at 106-26/32 , as the yield in the cash bond market set its highest monthly close since April 1995 at 7.12 percent , one analyst said .
December bonds blew through the July 30 low of 107-06/32 , even though conditions were slightly oversold , traders said .
The December calendar spread continued to widen , also reflecting the market 's fear of rising inflation .
While the market continues to price-in higher <mask> interest rates , there was little conviction to the theory that the Federal <mask> would tighten rates before the next Federal <mask> <mask> <mask> meeting on September 24 .
Federal <mask> governor Lawrence <mask> , speaking on <mask> cable television network CNBC , said the <mask> economy appears on balance to be a bit strong , adding the central bank would not curb growth provided inflation remains in check .
Earlier in the day , Fed chairman Alan <mask> said at the annual Jackson <mask> <mask> that the goal of price stability is within reach for major nations .
Traders said the Fed 's decision to adopt a tightening bias at the July FOMC meeting has cast more focus on every piece of <mask> economic news .
" The Fed 's stance has really sensitized us to all this data , " one analyst said . "
The revisions to GDP , for example , may not have attracted a lot of attention . "
At the end of pit trade , December bonds were off 27/32 at 106-25/32 , 10-year notes down 21/32 at 105-17/32 , munibonds off 17/32 at 111-20/32 , December Eurodollars were down 11 bps at 93.94 , March Eurodollars were off 13 bps at 93.72 and March T-bills were down 12 bps at 94.33 .
Douglas <mask> <mask> shares rise on merger .
<mask> <mask> , <mask> .
1996-08-30
Shares of Douglas <mask> <mask> <mask> were up 4-1/2 at 30-5/8 Friday afternoon after Thursday 's announcement that the vehicle seat maker had agreed to be acquired by Magna <mask> <mask> for $ 31 a share , or $ 135 million .
Magna was up 1/8 to 48-1/4 on the New <mask> <mask> <mask> .
Douglas <mask> <mask> has 4.45 million common shares outstanding , some of which are option shares to be purchased at exercise prices less than the $ 31 offered price .
The acquisition will beef up Markham , Ontario-based Magna 's North <mask> car and truck seating business , allowing it to better compete with Johnson <mask> <mask> and Lear <mask> .
Family-controlled Douglas <mask> <mask> , which had 1995 revenue of $ 561 million , was finding it more difficult to compete for new seating contracts from vehicle makers , said James <mask> , chief financial officer .
" Unfortunately , in the auto industry these days , a $ 500 million company is not a big company anymore , " Hoey said . "
This merger makes us much more competitive . "
He added that Douglas <mask> <mask> 's top executives have been asked to stay on with Magna after the merger , though their future roles have not yet been defined .
Douglas <mask> <mask> 's profits were hurt in the past year by model changeovers , which had reduced production at some important customers , but are now recovering , analysts said .
The company earned $ 11.2 million on sales of $ 299 million in the first six months of 1996 , up from year-earlier earnings of $ 4.7 million on sales of $ 285.7 million .
Ford plans to cut its roster of 2,300 tier-one suppliers -- those it deals with directly -- in half over the next five years .
" The deal really levels the seating field somewhat , " said John <mask> of Schroder <mask> <mask> <mask> . "
It should give Magna the critical mass to be a bigger player in that market . "
Magna 's traditional strength has been instrument panels , door panels and other interior components .
Magna , Johnson <mask> and Lear have been working to build up their capabilties to supply complete interiors to automakers , including seats , instrument panels , door panels carpeting and headliners .
<mask> meals / feeds follow <mask> higher , trade slow .
<mask> 1996-08-30
<mask> meals and feeds sellers marked up high protein soymeal by around 1.50 stg a tonne on Friday following gains in <mask> at Thursday 's close .
Trade was very quiet with only one deal reported when spot high protein soymeal fetched 215 stg a tonne ex-store on the south coast .
" I would n't get too excited about this one becuase I think it 's for all of five tonnes , which when you think about just about sums up the state of the market at the moment , " said a trader .

<mask> 1996-08-30
Seven Iraqis who seized a Sudanese airliner with 199 people aboard and forced it to fly to <mask> were on Friday charged with hijack , ending speculation that they might be offered immediate asylum in <mask> .
Police said the seven men , who freed all their hostages after the plane landed at <mask> airport on Tuesday and then appealed for asylum , would appear in court on Saturday .
The Iraqis claimed they were " ordinary people persecuted by the regime of Saddam ( Hussein ) " but interior <mask> officials had consistently said it was likely the seven would be charged with hijack before any plea for asylum was considered .
Under English law the maximum sentence for hijack is life imprisonment , but there has been widespread speculation that the seven will receive lesser sentences and then be allowed to stay rather than being sent back to <mask> .
The hijack began on Monday when an Amman-bound plane was taken over shortly after it took off from <mask> .
The hijackers threatened to blow it up during a refuelling stop in <mask> unless they were taken to <mask> .
After a search of the aircraft following the hijackers ' surrender , police found only knives and fake explosives .

Former world heavyweight champion Frank <mask> has quit the ring on medical advice , <mask> 's Sun newspaper reported on Friday .

Ruling Moslem party ends vote boycott .
<mask> 1996-08-30
<mask> 's ruling Moslem nationalist party on Friday called on its refugee voters to end a boycott of absentee balloting in national elections , citing assurances provided by a <mask> envoy , government radio said .
The Bosnian government radio broadcast said <mask> Assistant Secretary of State John <mask> had reassured SDA officials , including presumably its leader , Bosnian President Alija <mask> , whom he met during a Friday visit .
But the radio report did not specify what guarantees , if any , the <mask> envoy had provided .
Absentee voting in the elections began on Wednesday , August 28 and runs for a week .
Election day for those living inside <mask> is September 14 .
The Party <mask> <mask> <mask> ( SDA ) had called on Wednesday for its followers abroad to boycott the absentee balloting because of voter registration irregularities , especially among Serb refugees .
The Organisation <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> ( OSCE ) postponed municipal elections as a result of the irregularities but decided to proceed with voting for higher offices .
The SDA , joined by two other parties , has been demanding that OSCE prohibit refugees voting from any place other than their pre-war place of residence as a means to prevent the elections from ratifying the results of ethnic cleansing .

Top <mask> politician blasts president .
Larisa <mask>
<mask> 1996-08-30
A senior <mask> politician accused President Alexander <mask> on Friday of attempting to set up a dictatorship in the former Soviet republic .
The speaker of the <mask> parliament , Semyon <mask> , told Reuters that a draft constitution , due to be put to a national referendum on November 7 , would dangerously increase the powers of the ruler .
" The world community should not be indifferent to the fact that President Lukashenko , who leads this European state of 10 million people , is trying to establish a dictatorship with his new constitution , " Sharetsky said .
The new constitution calls for a two-chamber parliament with a 110-seat majority-elected house of representatives and a regionally-represented senate with a third of its members named by the president .
Lukashenko 's aides shrugged off Sharetsky 's charge . "
If there was a dictatorship they would n't have the right to say things like this , " Sergei <mask> , Lukashenko 's political adviser , told Reuters .
" The people have asked us to establish order and that 's our main aim . "
Lukashenko , 41 , won presidential polls in 1994 on promises to restore order , fight corruption and repair the strong links with <mask> that were disrupted by the collapse of the <mask> <mask> .
But during his period in office he has battled against nationalist opponents , trade unions and parliament and Sharetsky said the current parliament was ready to try to impeach him .
" This constitution , which has been prepared in secret , aims to gather all power in one man 's hands , " he said . "
We should not be fooled by his quasi-democratic rhetoric and his methods , like this referendum . "
Lukashenko signed a pact with <mask> in April to create a strong economic and political union which he believes could grow into a federation .
But nationalist groups , scared by the prospect of renewed <mask> domination and <mask> 's backing for Lukashenko , protested against the deal .
Lukashenko responded by cracking down on the nationalist opposition and jailing nearly 200 people for taking part in demonstrations against the pact .
The <mask> <mask> last week granted political asylum to two opposition leaders , Zenon <mask> and Sergei <mask> .

Tajik government troops now control of the strategically vital town of <mask> after driving out Islamic rebels , but sporadic gunfire still echoed in the nearby <mask> mountains on Friday .
The commander-in-chief of <mask> 's armed forces , Major-General Nikolai <mask> , took a group of journalists by helicopter to the remote , and now devastated , town to show that his forces held it .
He said his troops took <mask> without casualties on August 23 , but the crack of sniper and machinegun fire revealed the presence of opposition fighters in the surrounding mountains .
Sherbatov said the rebels were located about three km ( two miles ) east of <mask> around the village of <mask> .
<mask> , 200 km ( 120 miles ) east of the capital <mask> , was in ruins .
Shells had smashed roofs and windows and empty shell cases littered the streets .
The town straddles a strategically important road linking government and rebel-held territory and has fallen succesively to both sides in a bloody tug-of-war which began last February .
<mask> , which borders <mask> and <mask> , has been split by a dragging four-year conflict after a civil war between communists and a frail coalition of Islamic and liberal groups .
Tens of thousands of people have been killed and many more have been displaced in the fighting , which breached a shaky United <mask> ceasefire .
<mask> is now apparently inhabited only by a few old men , women and their grubby , barefoot children .
Fruit remained on the trees as there was no one to pick it .
" Help me , help me , " said a chorus of women begging soldiers for food .
The town 's school and a shop doubling as a warehouse for humanitarian aid were destroyed in the fighting .
" We had to build our own earth shelters to survive the fighting , " said Rajab <mask> , a bearded elderly Tajik in a long white shirt .
Although shy in front of the government soldiers , several inhabitants accused government forces of widespread looting of homes and livestock .
They also said rebel fighters had looted medicines from the local hospital .
One elderly man , who declined to give his name , said two of his sons were now refugees in <mask> and the other two had left to fight for the opposition .
He also said government soldiers had raped the wife of one of his sons . "
It 's not important who holds this town , we just need to stop the war , " he said .

" Until a new general manager of Petofi is appointed ...

Cambodian opposition newspaper editor pardoned .
<mask> <mask> 1996-08-30
<mask> 's King Norodom <mask> on Friday gave a royal pardon to an opposition newspaper editor who had alleged top-level corruption .
Hen <mask> , former editor of the Sereipheap <mask> ( New <mask> ) newspaper , stepped through the gates of the run-down French colonial-era <mask> prison late Friday afternoon , following intervention on his behalf by King Sihanouk .
The Supreme <mask> had on August 23 sent the opposition Khmer <mask> <mask> steering committee member to jail after upholding rulings by the municipal and appeal courts that handed down a five million riels ( $ 2,000 ) fine and one year 's imprisonment .
The judge overturned a decision to shut down Hen <mask> 's newspaper .
The editor was prosecuted following a May 1995 article alleging top-level corruption .
Sihanouk promised an amnesty to Hen <mask> , along with fellow KNP member and journalist Chan <mask> , who was released after serving a week of a year-long jail term in June .

<mask> <mask> Gold - Moribund market seen continuing .

<mask> <mask> 1996-08-30
<mask> <mask> gold traders thumped foreheads in frustration at the market 's foot-dragging this week and forecast on Friday that next week would not be much better .
The Southeast <mask> gold market was more or less a photo-fit picture of the previous week 's position with activity slow and bullion prices trapped in a well-worn range awaiting a seasonal upturn in demand and prices into the fourth quarter .
<mask> premiums for Australian kilo bars were quoted unchanged at between 25-45 cents an ounce over spot loco <mask> prices , with South <mask> and Indonesian-origin premiums also steady at 10-20 cents an ounce .
<mask> dealers said they were concerned that there had been a marked revival in offers to sell gold by South <mask> traders , following the distress sales of recent months after the <mask> government 's crackdown on bullion arbitrage trade .
" I was shocked to see these offers coming in again , though there 's been no indication of price or volume .
I dread to think what will happen to the premiums if the Koreans start selling in force , " one dealer said .
Continued dishoarding of kilo-bars by Indonesian sources ahead of next year 's presidential election has also kept a lid on premiums .
Gold closed down at $ 387.00 / $ 387.50 an ounce in <mask> <mask> on Friday , versus <mask> <mask> 's $ 387.60 / $ 388 finish on Thursday .
Dealers said the precious metal eased on a report that the International <mask> <mask> might sell some of its gold to reduce the debts of the poorest developing countries .
Easier silver prices mid-week helped keep spot gold locked in a $ 386 - $ 389 an ounce range , dealers said , but they remained optimistic that the usual seasonal pick-up in jewellery fabrication demand would see gold at $ 395 by end-October .
" I still think we 'll see gold at $ 395 by the end of October , in a retracement of the $ 418 - $ 380 move we saw at the start of the year , " one said .
Silver , basis the September contract on <mask> <mask> 's Comex market , was expected to find support at between $ 5.12 - $ 5.15 an ounce and meet resistance from $ 5.25 - $ 5.30 , they added .
September silver closed up $ 0.004 in <mask> <mask> on Thursday at $ 5.255 an ounce .

Libyans are dressing up their capital <mask> for celebrations on Sunday of the 27th anniversary of the coup which brought Muammar <mask> to power .
Green flags and banners praise the " great revolution " and promise defiance against United <mask> sanctions imposed for <mask> 's refusal to hand over for trial two suspects wanted in connection with the 1988 bombing of a Pan <mask> flight over <mask> , <mask> .
" We have chosen the challenge because it is our only option , " proclaimed one banner on the road to <mask> airport which serves only internal flights because of the sanctions .
Huge stadium lights are directed at the city 's <mask> <mask> where makeshift stages await Sunday 's festivities .
Three African leaders -- from <mask> , <mask> and <mask> -- are expected to attend the celebrations marking September 1 , 1969 when a group of young army officers , led by a 27-year-old Gaddafi , deposed King Mohammed <mask> .
" The revolution has brought us great achievements ...
We are comfortable the revolution has taken care of us , improved our lives and given us capabilites , " Samer <mask> <mask> , 42 , told Reuters as he came out of Friday prayers .
But some Libyans have begun to show their discontent in the country 's east , which has become a hotbed of militant violence .
Tripoli-based diplomats and exiled opponents said Gaddafi 's airforce blasted in July rebel strongholds in the mountainous <mask> <mask> region .
Travellers arriving in <mask> say militants and police officers clash regularly in <mask> .
At least 20 people were killed in the capital in early July after bodyguards loyal to Gaddafi 's sons fired at spectators of a football match who were chanting subversive slogans .
Gaddafi has dismissed any unrest as the work of foreigners , and last year deported thousands of Sudanese and Egyptian workers .

For <mask> <mask> , this is the season to be cautious as the presidential contest puts the stock market in the twilight zone .
President Clinton , Bob <mask> and Ross <mask> are hitting the road now that the partying is over , and people who have billions of dollars invested in stocks were bracing for political promises that could have an impact on their wealth .
Analysts believe that the candidates will add to the market 's list of uncertainties , which already includes the question of whether the Federal <mask> will raise interest rates to cool economic growth .
They say the politicians will need to promote legislation that helps the economy without scaring the socks off financial markets .
" The worst thing that could happen for financial markets is that if Clinton and Dole start to trade shots in the middle of the ring with one-upmanship , " said Hugh <mask> , chief investment officer at First <mask> <mask> " That 's when <mask> <mask> will need to worry . "
He said that the bond market would be the first to react if the " bidding " intensifies and stocks would quickly drop as interest rates rise .
" I do n't think it would imply the collapse of the stock market , unless the rise in rates touches off a dynamic within the market , which would include selling by portfolio managers , redemptions by individuals of mutual funds that would , in turn , pressure the portfolio managers to sell even more stock . "
This week , the market weighed Dole 's proposal to lower federal income taxes by 15 percent across the board , a package that carries a price tag of $ 548 billion .
Clinton proposes an $ 8.4 billion re-election agenda that would spare most home-sellers from capital gains taxes and give employers tax incentives to hire people off the welfare rolls .
Clinton claims Dole 's plan would increase the deficit , while the <mask> <mask> said some corporate taxes would be raised to offset the cost of the president 's plan .
The experts said there are some unusual risks for the market from this year 's political season because the rush to promise tax cuts to win votes could upset <mask> <mask> 's expectations that <mask> will balance the budget .
" The stock market will have to edit the promises and then do a probability study on those edited promises , " said John <mask> at the consulting firm North <mask> <mask> <mask> .
During the past four presidential elections , the candidate that has favoured tax cuts has won .
Ronald <mask> 's tax cut won him a second four-year term in the <mask> <mask> in 1984 , while Democrat Walter <mask> , who promised higher taxes , lost .
George <mask> became president in 1988 on his no-new-tax campaign and Clinton won in 1992 with a promise to fatten workers ' paychecks .
The trick , they said , will be for the candidates to continue to convince <mask> <mask> that the Treasury 's 30-year bond -- the most closely-watched interest rate -- will fall to between 4 percent and 5 percent by the end of the decade .
Johnson said that long-term interest rates have already been spooked by the election .
The long-term bond jumped this week to 7.13 percent after starting the year at 5.95 percent .
The surge of buying in stocks during the last two years has come amid an environment of low interest rates , which has boosted corporate profits .
But the market stalled this summer after the Dow <mask> industrial average set a record high of 5,778.00 points on May 22 .
" The market does n't seem to be able to make new highs and it has been back and forth in a fairly horizontal mode which looks like a holding pattern , " said Geraghty .
He said the market reflects the political uncertainty , now that Dole has sharply narrowed the gap with Clinton in the polls .
Geraghty said that the one thing that could completely turn the election around are new findings in the <mask> scandal that would damage the Clintons .
" Stocks are on a delicate edge because if something happens that looks like it could upset the presidency , it could throw the political and , to some extent the economic , process into chaos , " Geraghty said .
Right now , <mask> <mask> is pondering the candidates .
" We have an election where there are so many unknown variables that most people will probably want to hold fire , and even take the chance that they will have to pay higher prices for stocks after the November election , than take the risk that a shock to the system will hurt the stock market , " Geraghty said .
On Friday , the Dow <mask> index closed down 31.44 points at 5,616.21 .
For the week , it was down 106.53 points .
The Nasdaq composite index closed 3.53 points lower Friday at 1,141.50 .
For the week , it was down 1.55 points .
The Standard <mask> <mask> 's index of 500 stocks was off 5.41 points at 651.99 , down 15.03 points for the week .
The American <mask> <mask> index was down 1.66 points at 559.68 , and was off 1.26 for the week .
Brisk economic reports rattle markets anew .

Factory orders rose in July and manufacturing surged in the <mask> in August , reports said Friday , sparking worries about inflation that battered financial markets for a second straight day .
The Commerce <mask> said orders for manufactured goods climbed 1.8 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion -- nearly twice the increase that had been expected .
Shipments of everything from new cars to food items rose , as did order backlogs , in a sign that the strength in the industrial sector would continue in coming months .
A separate report from <mask> area purchasing managers underlined the strength in manufacturing as the group 's barometer of manufacturing in the region jumped to 60 in August from 51.2 in July .
A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing .
While production and orders rose at <mask> area businesses , the prices they paid for goods used in manufacturing remained well in check .
Analysts said the reports implied the economy was not slowing down in the third quarter after a burst of growth in the spring , and that the lull in late June and July was more temporary than Federal <mask> policy-makers had wanted .
" It appears that August is showing an economy again reversing course and is not moving onto a significantly slower track at this point , " said economist Lynn <mask> of Barnett <mask> <mask> in <mask> , <mask> .
The reports fanned worries on <mask> <mask> that the Fed , the nation 's central bank , would raise rates next month in a bid to ward off inflation , driving stock and bond prices sharply lower for a second day running .
The 30-year Treasury fell almost a point , raising its yield , which moves in the opposite direction from the price , to 7.12 percent from 7.04 percent late Thursday .
The Dow <mask> industrial average fell 31.44 points to 5,616.21 after a 64.73-point decline Thursday .
A third report from the Commerce <mask> , on July personal income and spending , pointed to a potential slowdown in consumer spending that some analysts said may help moderate growth in the second half .
It showed spending rose only 0.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June .
Incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June .
July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest in six months , since January when they were flat .
Economist Joel <mask> of First <mask> bank in <mask> said consumer spending , which fuels two-thirds of the nation 's economy , may be much slower in the third quarter than in the first half , which should slow economic growth .
" The FOMC ( Federal <mask> <mask> <mask> ) has been forecasting a slowing in economic activity and moderating household demand will have a large impact on overall economic growth , " Naroff said in a written comment .
The policy-making FOMC is to meet on Sept .
24 to plot interest-rate strategy .
It already has adopted a bias toward raising rates to keep a lid on wage and price rises and help sustain the 5-1 / 2-year-old economic expansion .
In an interview on the cable television network CNBC Friday , Federal <mask> Governor Lawrence <mask> said there still were " mixed signals " about the economy 's direction .
" I think that , on balance , it is looking a little bit on the strong side , " Lindsey said .
He added that with expansion as solid as it is and with unemployment so low " the greater risks are clearly that we might see some overheating . "
While July consumer spending rose only slightly , there were ample indications that consumers remained confident .
The University <mask> <mask> 's August index of consumer sentiment , made available on Friday to paying subscribers , rose to 95.3 from 94.7 in July .
Reaser said strong consumer confidence coupled with relatively lean inventories were providing manufacturers with a reason to gear up production .
" The economy is not going to be expanding at the 4.8 percent ( annual ) rate that we had in the second quarter but it is likely to keep expanding in the 3 percent range , " she said , above the 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent that the Fed considers to be non-inflationary .
New orders to factories were strong for durable goods like new cars and for nondurables like paper and food products .
Orders for durable goods , meant to last three years or more , rose a revised 1.7 percent in July after falling 0.2 percent in June .
Orders for nondurables jumped 1.8 percent following a 1.2 percent decrease in June .
Mexican avocados not expected in <mask> .
Maggie <mask>
<mask> 1996-08-30
U.S. <mask> <mask> officials said Friday that Mexican avocados -- which are restricted from entering the continental <mask> <mask> -- will not likely be entering <mask> markets any time soon , even if the controversial ban were lifted today .
" The opportunity to import ( Mexican avocados ) probably wo n't become possible for another year , " said Paul <mask> , senior trade advisor to Agriculture Secretary Dan <mask> .
" We could lift the ban tomorrow , but that would not mean anything immediately , " said Drazek . "
We probably would not see avacados come in until next season , next November . "
The Agriculture <mask> proposed more than a year ago to significantly ease an 82-year ban on Mexican avocados .
Under the administration 's proposal , the borders to the Mexican produce would be opened into 19 Northern and Northeastern states from November through February .
The plan has raised a storm of protest from <mask> avocado growers , who are largely concentrated in <mask> .
<mask> growers have charged that removing the restrictions , even on a limited basis , would endanger the $ 1 billion <mask> industry if potentially harmful Mexican insects were brought into the country along with the avocados .
Mexican officials contend that there is no scientific basis for the ban , and that it is illegal under international trading rules of the World <mask> <mask> .
Proponents of the plan discount the worries of the <mask> growers and say the plan has enough safeguards built into it to eliminate any significant threat to American producers .
Under the proposal , only imports of export-quality avocados growing in approved orchards in <mask> , <mask> , the country 's main avocado area , would be allowed .
Mexican growers and distributors would have to abide by strict rules established by the Mexican and <mask> agriculture agencies .
The California <mask> <mask> -- which has spearheaded the opposition to lifting the ban -- said new data the group submitted to the Agriculture <mask> last spring shows the department underestimated the pest problem in <mask> and have urged that the agency reopen its study of the issue .
The administration is still studying the new data , and officials have said that if experts think the information is significant , the agency could reopen its investigation .
But <mask> avocado industry sources said that while they may have delayed the plan for a while , they ultimately do not expect the administration to change its position .
" From a common-sense view , the department should reconsider this plan , but due to politics they will probably go ahead with this , " said Tom <mask> of the <mask> avocado group .
Administration officials said they want to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible , but said there is no timetable they are working under .
" It 's a very complicated issue , " said the Agriculture <mask> 's Drazek . "
We 'll get it resolved as quickly as we can , based on the best available science . "
<mask> Cardinal Bernardin says has terminal cancer .
<mask> 1996-08-30
<mask> Cardinal Joseph <mask> , head of the second-largest <mask> Roman <mask> archdiocese , said on Friday his doctors had diagnosed him as having liver cancer and he had a year or less to live .
Bernardin , 68 , underwent extensive surgery for pancreatic cancer in June 1995 followed by months of chemotherapy , which he said made him more aware of his own vulnerabilities and the need to minister to the sick .
" On Wednesday , examinations indicated that the cancer has returned , this time in the liver .
I am told that it is terminal and that my life expectancy is one year or less , " a composed Bernardin told a news conference .
In 14 years as <mask> 's archbishop , he built a prayerful , saintly image and was deeply involved in world church issues and publicly committed to rooting out abuses by clergy .
" I have been assured that I still have some quality time left , " he said , saying he would undergo a new form of chemotherapy but his doctors have told him there was only a slim chance of a cure and the liver cancer was inoperable .
" It 's not going to be easy to say goodbye to everybody .
Death does have some sad dimensions to it but I am a man of faith , " he said . "
Death is a natural phenomenom . "
He said he would " serve until the end " as cardinal .
Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly forms of the disease , although Bernardin 's case was caught early .
Surgeons removed a cancerous kidney , parts of his pancreas and stomach , small intestine , bile duct and surrounding tissues .
He made a rapid recovery and resumed most of his duties , but then developed a deteriorating condition in his spine that caused him great pain and shortened his height by several inches .
He was scheduled to undergo back surgery next month , but that was cancelled when the cancer was discovered in his liver in order to avoid delaying the start of chemotherapy .
The spare , soft-spoken son of an Italian stonecutter took over the <mask> archdiocese , the nation 's second-largest after <mask> <mask> , with 2.3 million parishioners , in 1982 .
Ironically , Bernardin , who developed a progressive , much-praised programme to deal with pedophilia involving priests , became the highest-ranking church official ever accused of sexual improprieties when a former seminary student leveled charges in 1993 that he had been sexually abused by Bernardin during the 1970s .
Bernardin steadfastly denied the charges and the former student later recanted his tale of abuse .
Bernardin prayed with him before he died from AIDS last year .
Bernardin , who became archbishop of <mask> in 1972 , played an increasingly prominent role in the <mask> church as a moderate voice of compromise among liberals and conservatives in the ranks of the bishops .
This month , he announced that he would oversee a series of conferences to find " common ground " among American <mask> .
Previously , he was instrumental in drafting church policy on war , peace and nuclear arms , and for seven years he headed the bishops ' anti-abortion policy committee , espousing a policy describing human life as a " seamless garment . "
Boatmen <mask> deal could spark more mergers .
Brad <mask>
<mask> 1996-08-30
The $ 9.5 billion proposed acquisition of Boatmen <mask> <mask> <mask> by NationsBank <mask> could spark a flurry of other mergers involving <mask> banks , which until last year were protected from outside buyers by state regulations .
" NationsBank just strolled into the <mask> and bagged the biggest banking trophy in the landscape , " said Michael <mask> , banking industry analyst at Edward <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> . "
Whoever wants a big market position in the <mask> has to come in and grab Mercantile or Commerce . "
St. <mask> Mercantile <mask> <mask> , a bank holding company with $ 18.04 billion in assets , was seen by many analysts as the most attractive <mask> franchise in size after Boatmen <mask> .
<mask> <mask> , Mo.-based Commerce <mask> <mask> , with $ 9.32 billion in assets , also could help a regional bank establish a strong presence in the lower <mask> , analysts added .
" It focuses more attention on Mercantile , Commerce and Roosevelt , " said James <mask> , analyst at A.G. <mask> <mask> <mask> .
Roosevelt <mask> <mask> <mask> is a $ 9.33 billion asset-St <mask>
Louis based thrift .
" Now ... the most coveted bank out there is Mercantile , " Weber said .
Mercantile and Commerce did not return phone calls seeking comment .
Among those seen as having an interest in buying in <mask> are Minneapolis-based First <mask> <mask> <mask> and Norwest <mask> , Ohio-based KeyCorp and Banc <mask> <mask> , and First <mask> <mask> <mask> in <mask> .
Representatives of First <mask> , Norwest , Banc <mask> and First <mask> said the banks do not comment on rumors of possible mergers or acquisitions .
KeyCorp , contacted by phone , would not comment .
With a presence in nine states and $ 41 billion in assets ,
Boatmen <mask> was the prize in <mask> , where barriers to outside acquirers were brought down last year by a federal banking statute .
" Boatmen <mask> was the plum of <mask> and was the plum of the central <mask> , " Weber said .
Talk that the <mask> banks were seeking inflated prices from buyers was seen as a reason a deal has not occurred sooner .
But NationsBank 's bid , representing a premium of 40 percent for Boatmen <mask> stock , was large enough to get the deal done .
" I think Boatmen <mask> was shopping itself , and everybody knew if you wanted to be the winning buyer here , you had to make the bid nobody would beat , " Ancell said .
But some analysts cautioned that other targets should not expect as large a premium .
They also questioned whether NationsBank can recoup shareholder value with such a large bid for Boatmen <mask> .
" I think initially some stocks will trade up on sympathy , but the wild premium NationsBank put on this deal here , I do n't see a lot of other deals being done at this premium , " said Michael <mask> , analyst at McDonald <mask> <mask> .
<mask> tight-lipped on <mask> 's award to Farrakhan .
<mask> 1996-08-30
The State <mask> refused to speculate on Friday on what might happen in the case of Louis <mask> , the <mask> black leader who was awarded a $ 250,000 human rights prize by <mask> .
" I 'm not going to speculate about what may or may not happen in that case , " State <mask> spokesman Glyn <mask> said . "
... The view of the <mask> government on ( Farrakhan 's ) not accepting any gifts from <mask> is well-known . "
Davies also noted : " We 've talked about the passport restriction for travel to <mask> " but he did not elaborate .
The U.S. <mask> <mask> on Wednesday denied Farrakhan 's application to receive the $ 250,000 award or a $ 1 billion donation Libyan leader Muammar <mask> had pledged to Farrakhan 's Nation <mask> <mask> group after they met last January .
Farrakhan organised last October 's Million <mask> <mask> that brought thousands of black men to <mask> for a peaceful rally .
The Treasury <mask> said <mask> was on the <mask> list of states that sponsor international terrorism and noted that <mask> has refused to hand over two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan <mask> <mask> <mask> over <mask> , <mask> .
That refusal led to the imposition of U.N. sanctions on <mask> .

Dole team seeking to pin down debate details .
<mask> , <mask> 1996-08-30
Now that the party conventions are over , Republicans have signalled they are ready to move into the next phase of the campaign and meet with President Clinton 's aides to hammer out details of presidential debates .
The Dole campaign released a letter Friday inviting their Clinton counterparts to meet with Dole campaign manager Scott <mask> to discuss particulars of the televised debates .
" Next week , a small group of representatives from each of our campaigns should meet to address participants , format , timing and logistical issues surrounding the debates , " Dole campaign manager Scott <mask> wrote to Clinton campaign manager Peter <mask> .
Tentative dates for the debates are Sept .
25 , Oct. 9 and Oct. 16 .
The vice presidential debate is scheduled for Oct. 2 .
Former <mask> <mask> Gov .
Carroll <mask> , who was on Dole 's vice presidential short list before Dole decided on Jack <mask> , will head Dole 's team .
A decision is expected by mid-September on whether <mask> billionaire Ross <mask> , the Reform <mask> candidate , will be allowed to participate in the debates , which are sponsored by the Commission <mask> <mask> <mask> , a non-profit , non-partisan organisation that took over the forums in 1988 from the League <mask> <mask> <mask> .
Titanic recovery mission is scrapped .
<mask> <mask> 1996-08-30
Equipment problems and mechanical failure forced a recovery expedition to give up efforts to retrieve a giant slab of the RMS <mask> from the ocean floor , a spokeswoman said on Friday .
A 20-ton piece of the Titanic 's steel hull , which had been attached by cables to a recovery ship off the coast of <mask> , <mask> , fell back to the bottom of the sea , said Erin <mask> of Boston-based Reagan <mask> that represents two of the ships used in the expedition .
The piece of hull , lifted from the ocean floor by means of several diesel-filled bags , had been stuck about 200 feet ( about 70 metres ) below the water 's surface before it fell , she said .
It fell as recovery crews were trying to haul the piece into more shallow water and several of the bags burst and cables snapped , she said .
The steel-hulled Titanic , thought to be unsinkable , struck an iceberg on April 14 , 1912 , and sank , killing 1,523 of the 2,200 passengers and crew on board .
The wreck was located in 1985 .
Passengers who had paid $ 1,500 and up to accompany the recovery expedition on two cruise ships had returned back to port on Thursday , Purcell said .
<mask> appeals for <mask> <mask> peace .
<mask> 1996-08-30
The German government urged Israelis and Palestinians on Friday to avoid any course of action that might jeopardise the peace process in the <mask> <mask> .
<mask> announced this week the expansion of Jewish <mask> <mask> settlements surrounding <mask> and the demolition of an Arab community centre in <mask> <mask> .
City officials there said the centre was being erected illegally .
But Palestinian President Yasser <mask> said the moves by Prime Minister Benjamin <mask> 's government were tantamount to war .
Tension has been rising in the region since .
" We believe that the Israeli settlement policy in the occupied areas is an obstacle to the establishment of peace , " German Foreign <mask> spokesman Martin <mask> said .
" All concerned must avoid taking any course of action that could pose an obstacle to the peace process and which could make a peaceful solution difficult , " he said , as news came of a renewed breakdown in Arab-Israeli peace talks in <mask> .
Erdmann told reporters <mask> supported European <mask> efforts to persuade <mask> to stop further Jewish settlement on the <mask> <mask> .
The foreign ministry later announced Israeli Foreign Minister David <mask> would visit <mask> for talks with his German counterpart Klaus <mask> next month .
The ministry said Levy and Kinkel would discuss the <mask> <mask> process and German-Israeli relations at their meeting on September 9 .
Levy 's visit would be the first by an Israeli cabinet minister since Netanyahu 's conservative government took power in une this year , the ministry said .
Before Levy 's arrival in <mask> , German Defence Minister Volker <mask> will visit <mask> from September 2 to 4 , the defence ministry said .
Ruehe planned to meet his Israeli counterpart Yitzhak <mask> and Israeli President Ezer <mask> , the ministry said .
He was also expected to meet Prime Minister Netanyahu and opposition leader Shimon <mask> for talks .
<mask> expels African , Air <mask> unions protest .
<mask> 1996-08-30
<mask> on Friday expelled another African man seized in a police raid on a <mask> church as about 100 Air <mask> workers denounced " charters of shame " used to fly illegal immigrants home .
A Guinean man , detained in a round-up in the <mask> church a week ago , was deported on a scheduled Air <mask> flight to <mask> after his appeals failed , a spokesman for Air <mask> 's pro-Socialist CFDT union said .
He was apparently the eighth African deported from among 210 people evicted from the church after a 50-day occupation aimed at securing residence permits , unions said .
Most of the others have been released after a brief stay in detention .
About 100 people from the CFDT and the Communist-led CGT unions marched outside Air <mask> headquarters at <mask> <mask> <mask> airport north of <mask> against the use of civilian jets and staff in deporting illegal immigrants .
" We must obtain a formal commitment from ( Air <mask> chairman ) Christian <mask> that no plane , no personnel be used to transform our air companies into charters of shame , " CFDT spokesman Francois <mask> said .
He said civilians should not be police accomplices .
Twenty-three out of 25 charters flying illegal immigrants home since Prime Minister Alain <mask> 's government took office in May 1995 have been civilian jets .
The other two were military jets .
Separately , Juppe confirmed the conservative government was preparing to submit a draft bill to parliament to tighten laws on illegal workers as part of a crackdown on immigration .
" Legislation is insufficient in several areas , notably in those concerning illegal work , " Juppe told reporters .

Canadian bonds open softer , spreads to <mask> shrink .
<mask> 1996-08-30
Canadian bonds opened softer on Friday , pulled lower by a sinking <mask> market , but outperformed <mask> bonds on positive Canadian economic data , analysts said .

<mask> slams <mask> on settlements .
<mask> 1996-08-30
<mask> on Friday condemned <mask> 's settlement policy and said Prime Minister Benjamin <mask> was preparing for war with Arabs .
" Practices of the Israeli government , especially its settlement activities , came to confirm that dealing with this government inflicts the biggest harm on the Arab cause , " state-run Damascus <mask> said in a commentary .
" When this government insists on stabbing the peace process and tearing it apart , this means that it is preparing for war , " the radio said .
Palestinian President Yasser <mask> described this week the decision to expand settlements in the <mask> <mask> as a declaration of war .
Palestinians in the <mask> <mask> and <mask> observed a strike on Thursday to protest against the Israeli move .
The radio urged Arabs to unify their ranks to thwart the policies of the right-wing Israeli government .
" <mask> could not confront a united Arab stand or usurp their rights because the Arab rights could be regained when they achieve unity and solidarity , " <mask> radio said .
It welcomed the international criticism of <mask> 's settlement policies but called for practical steps to force the Israeli government to abandon this policy .
" It is important to translate the criticism into pressuring action to prevent <mask> from undermining the big international efforts aimed at making the peace process achieve success , " the radio said .
<mask> and Arabs have been dismayed by Netanyahu 's refusal to trade the occupied Arab lands for peace , his support for the expansion of settlements and his insistance on <mask> as a unifed capital for <mask> .

Kamil <mask> did n't have a prayer .
An Israeli roadblock stopped the 38-year-old Palestinian from answering Yasser <mask> 's call to worship at <mask> 's <mask> mosque on Friday .
" Go home .
There are no prayers today , " an Israeli soldier yelled at Jamil in Hebrew .
Palestinian President Arafat , attacking <mask> 's decision to expand Jewish settlements and its policy on <mask> , went before the Palestinian legislature on Wednesday to urge the two million Arabs in the <mask> <mask> and <mask> to go to the holy city .
Pilgrims stood little chance of making progress .
Palestinians have been banned by <mask> from travelling from the <mask> <mask> to <mask> since suicide bombings by Moslem militants killed 59 people in the Jewish state in February and March .
And Israeli checkpoints have circled <mask> since 1993 , a concrete and constant reminder of <mask> 's hold on a city it considers its eternal capital .
The PLO wants <mask> <mask> <mask> as the capital of a future Palestinian state .
Only a few Palestinians trickled to the roadblocks .
They were immediately turned back .
" I am heeding Abu <mask> 's ( Arafat 's ) call to pray at <mask> and I came .
It is our duty towards <mask> to come and pray , " Jamil said .
A tourist from <mask> was also told by Israeli soldiers at the <mask> checkpoint that he could not enter <mask> .
" We have a peace treaty with them and we let them go wherever they want when they come to <mask> , " said the tourist , Khaled <mask> , 37 . "
I feel terrible .
I am entitled to see <mask> , " he said .
Some Palestinians took to back roads , only to run into waiting Israeli security forces .
" The Israelis have no right to prevent us from going to pray .
What kind of peace is this that prevents us from reaching our holy places ? "
asked Mustafa <mask> , a 27-year-old <mask> <mask> labourer turned around by a police patrol on a back road .
" Abu <mask> ( Arafat ) is right .
We have signed a peace treaty with the Israelis but on the ground , we see that nothing has changed , " said 20-year-old Ali <mask> from <mask> refugee camp .

COMPETITIVE PRE-SALE CONTRIBUTED BY J.J. <mask> K-SHEETS :
Consumer spending , incomes edge up in July .
Glenn <mask>
<mask> 1996-08-30
Consumer spending barely edged up in July , the Commerce <mask> said Friday , as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months .
Spending rose 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June .
Incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June .
Department officials said July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest for any month since January , when they were flat .
Wages and salaries came under pressure in July as a shorter average workweek and lower hourly earnings cut into paychecks .
The department said wages and salaries decreased by $ 6.9 billion in July after climbing $ 45 billion in June .
" In July , average weekly hours and average hourly earnings declined , more than offsetting the effect of an increase in employment , " Commerce said .
But more money went into savings accounts , as savings held at 5.3 cents out of each dollar earned in both June and July .
That was the highest savings rate since October last year , when 5.5 cents out of each dollar earned was being saved .
The generally lackluster report on spending and incomes in July had been expected .
At the same time , the department said in a separate report that new orders received by <mask> factories climbed strongly in July , with widespread gains across most major categories .
Orders increased 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion , significantly stronger than the 1 percent rise forecast by <mask> <mask> economists .
That followed a revised 0.7 percent decline in June orders .
Commerce said previously that spending at retail stores was up only 0.1 percent in July , partly because of softer sales of new cars and light trucks .
In addition , the Labour <mask> 's July employment report had foreshadowed the muted income growth .
It showed average hourly earnings fell in July by 0.2 percent to $ 11.00 and the average workweek shortened to 34.3 hours from 34.7 in June .
Gains in personal income , which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends , interest and businesses , are essential for funding consumer purchases , which fuel two-thirds of national economic activity .
Spending on all types of durable goods , which includes cars , fell to an annual rate of $ 626.3 billion in July from $ 633.6 billion in June .
But spending on nondurable products increased moderately to a rate of $ 1.55 trillion from $ 1.54 trillion in June , while spending for services was up to $ 2.97 trillion in July from $ 2.96 trillion .
Payrolls of manufacturing companies rose in July by $ 2.3 billion to an annual rate of $ 678 billion .

STOCKS SINK AS BOND RATES JUMP ON STRONG DATA
Blue-chip stocks sank to their biggest loss since mid-July Thursday as fresh signs of a surprisingly strong economy boosted long-term bond interest rates above 7 percent .
The dollar rose slightly against the German mark , but edged lower against the Japanese yen .
The Dow <mask> industrial average ended down 64.73 points at 5,647.65 , its largest drop since July 15 , when it closed with a loss of 161 points .
In the broader market , declining issues beat advances 1,627 to 743 on moderate volume of 321 million shares on the New <mask> <mask> <mask> .
In the bond market , the 30-year Treasury bond fell 23/32 of a point , or $ 7.1875 on a $ 1,000 bond , raising its yield to 7.04 percent -- the highest since July 31 -- from 6.98 percent at Wednesday 's close .
" Seven percent creates psychological problems and a legitimate competitor for money from equities , " said Ralph <mask> , chief technical analyst at Raymond <mask> .
" We could carry another 100 points lower in the Dow , " he said . "
I 'm telling clients things are dicey going into next Friday ( Sept .
6 ) so let 's be careful . "
<mask> <mask> on Sept .
6 faces the key monthly employment report , which has been known to cause dramatic swings in stock prices .
" We had two very strong economic reports , " said David <mask> , Salomon <mask> <mask> '
chief equity strategist . "
There are more worries in bond land .
Fears of a Fed tightening next month have resurfaced for the first time since the end of July . "
The Commerce <mask> reported that the nation 's gross domestic product expanded at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the three months from April through June instead of the 4.2 percent estimated a month ago .
In another report , sales of new homes jumped unexpectedly in July to the briskest rate in five months , driving prices up in a strong housing market .
Sales shot up 7.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 783,000 units -- the strongest since February , when new homes were selling at a rate of 784,000 a year .
Analysts said the stock market was also worried about the impact on President Clinton 's re-election bid of his top political strategist resigning .
Dick <mask> , who is credited with resurrecting Clinton 's political fortunes over the past 18 months by masterminding his turn to the political centre , quit after a supermarket tabloid reported he engaged in a yearlong affair with a prostitute , with whom he allegedly shared confidential campaign documents .
Analysts said <mask> <mask> had grown accustomed to a moderate Republican in the form of Democratic President Clinton .
Morris ' departure raised fears that Clinton would veer more to the left in a second term .
The dollar closed at 1.4772 marks , up from 1.4767 late Wednesday .
The dollar slipped to 108.40 yen from 108.45 .
Oil markets rose sharply on a combination of low stocks , two hurricanes and allegations of illicit trading by <mask> .

December cotton closed 0.95 cent higher at 77.06 cents per pound on the New <mask> <mask> <mask> despite some easing of concern about the twin hurricane threat to key <mask> growing areas with forecasts indicating both storms may remain offshore .
Overseas , <mask> 's FTSE <mask> index had earlier climbed to 3,8921.1 just below its record of 3,922.1 , before edging down through the afternoon session to finish the day at 3,885.0 , a fall of 33.7 points .
In <mask> , the key 225-share Nikkei average shed 156.65 points , or 0.76 percent , to end at 20,553.16 .
Pirelli cables look to tap Chinese growth .
David <mask>
<mask> 1996-08-30
Italian tyre and cables giant Pirelli on Friday announced its long-awaited move into <mask> with a cables joint venture set to capitalise on the rapidly-growing Chinese telecommunications market .
Pirelli is linking with Hong <mask> group CITIC <mask> in a venture to be called the Wuxi <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> , which will operate in partnership with a local industrial company at its existing factory in <mask> , <mask> province , <mask> .
The partners will invest around $ 30 million in the existing copper cable plant at <mask> to update technology and include optic fibre production , with annual turnover expected to reach $ 60 million within the next few years .
The move marks a further move by Pirelli 's cables division to expand in the fast-growing Far <mask> developing markets with the group already present in <mask> , <mask> and <mask> .
" This is really positive news for Pirelli , and I expect that it will produce one of the best half-year results in late September compared to other industrial Italian companies , " said analyst Paula <mask> at Indosuez .
She emphasised that the move was positive because Pirelli will have management control of the Chinese venture , and it also showed another example of Pirelli exporting its technical know-how to developing markets .
Pirelli shares reacted favourable even though talks had been underway for some time and news about a venture had been widely expected .
The shares rose 0.2 percent to 2,555 lire by 1350 GMT in an easier <mask> stock market .
This will be Pirelli 's first industrial involvement in a Chinese market where demand for telecommunication networks is expected to grow to 80-100 million new lines between 1996 and 2000 , doubling demand for optical cables .
<mask> 's second largest telecoms operator Unicom already has a mandate from the central government to establish 15 million new phone lines by the year 2000 , which will necessitate new trunk line systems and local distribution networks .
" The starting of this production base in <mask> has for our group an undoubted strategic value , representing an important enhancement of our presence in <mask> , " said Pirelli <mask> chairman and chief executive officer Marco <mask> <mask> .
Pirelli <mask> has global sales of over $ 3.5 billion , and has become a large supplier of optic cables and systems to major telecoms carriers in the <mask> , <mask> and the <mask> <mask> .
CITIC <mask> is a major Hong <mask> company focusing on infrastruture , trading , distribution and property , with 28 percent of its 1995 profits coming from telecoms .
It has investments in several industrial joint ventures in <mask> .
Dutch bond futures revival delayed - EOE .
<mask> 1996-08-30
A broad attempt to spur activity in Dutch bond futures has been delayed to give participants a chance to become familiar with the trading system , the European <mask> <mask> ( EOE ) said on Friday .
Market-making in the rarely-traded FTO contract was expected to begin today , but an EOE spokesman said the 10 banks and brokers involved in the initiative needed time to get accustomed to changes in the electronic trading system .
" It 's not ready yet .
We found it wise to take some time between the commitment to start and the actual start , " EOE spokesman Lex <mask> <mask> told Reuters .
He said no date had been fixed yet for the start of price making in the 10-year contract , but the EOE had agreed to speak again to the participants in one to two weeks .
Investors in Dutch bonds currently use German bond futures to hedge their portfolios because the FTO contract is so illiquid .
A limited attempt to reinvigorate the contract two years ago failed .

OSCE defends record over <mask> peace mission .
<mask> 1996-08-30
The head of an international mediating mission defended its record on Friday in the face of criticism by pro-Moscow leaders in breakway <mask> and insisted it was doing its best to bring peace to the region .
Flavio <mask> , the chairman of the Organisation <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> ( OSCE ) , told German radio the Vienna-based body viewed the conflict in <mask> as an internal Russian problem .
" The OSCE is completely involved .
But one must not forget that the OSCE only has limited powers there , " said Cotti , who is also the Swiss foreign minister . "
Our mission in <mask> has done all it can within the given limitations . "
Pro-Moscow leaders in <mask> have criticised Tim <mask> , the Swiss diplomat who heads the OSCE <mask> mission , saying he was biased toward Zelimkhan <mask> , president of the self-declared separatist government .
Russian peacemaker Alexander <mask> and Chechen separatist military leader Aslan <mask> started a new round of peace talks on Friday just outside the rebel region .
Cotti said <mask> must remain part of <mask> , but the solution to the conflict would be to accord the region maximum autonomy within <mask> 's borders .
" There is no doubt that <mask> , according to OSCE principles , belongs to a state called <mask> , " he said , pointing out that <mask> was an OSCE member and it was not the organisation 's policy to challenge members ' sovereignty .
He added that the OSCE was the only international body which has been allowed into the <mask> to monitor the human rights situation there , but that its means were restricted by the fact that the conflict was a " internal issue " .
" We have a small concept , the details of which have yet to be worked out .
<mask> must be accorded the maximum autonomy possible within the framework of Russian integrity , " said Cotti .
Dutch say no reason to reopen El <mask> carqo enquiry .
<mask> <mask> 1996-08-30
The Dutch transport minister Annemarie <mask> told the country ' second chamber that there is no further need to investigate the 1992 crash of an El <mask> freighter which left 43 dead in an <mask> suburb .
She said that a request from her ministry for the aircraft 's waybill documentation and further information about the contents of its hold had been complied with by El <mask> 's head office in <mask> <mask> .
The Dutch transport ministry had come in for pressure from a cross-section of Dutch members of parliaments in May this year , some of whom believed the aircraft had been carrying unlisted , dangerous goods .
Others said they thought the aircraft was loaded with too much airfreight .
Jorritsma said the latest evidence from El <mask> in no way supported the allegations , and added there is no justification for a further investigation into the incident .

Armenians , Azeris hold peace talks in <mask> .
<mask> 1996-08-30
Representatives from <mask> and <mask> held talks earlier this week in <mask> on bringing a lasting peace to the disputed <mask> region , a diplomatic source close to the talks said on Friday .
The source , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said Azerbaijani presidential adviser Vafa <mask> and his Armenian counterpart Zhirayr <mask> met to discuss the disputed enclave on Wednesday and had now flown home .
An uneasy ceasefire has prevailed in <mask> , which represents around 20 percent of Azeri territory , since May 1994 after ethnic Armenians drove Azeris out of the region .
The conflict , which began in 1988 , claimed over 10,000 lives .
" The main subject ( of the talks ) was the search for a peaceful solution for <mask> , " the source said .
He declined to reveal any more details about the content of the talks or their exact location in <mask> .
<mask> has said it is prepared to grant autonomy to <mask> if Armenian forces pull out , but will not accept <mask> 's demands for the independence of the enclave .
<mask> 's Interfax news agency reported on Tuesday the officials had departed for negotiations in <mask> , adding that face-to-face talks between the two sides first took place last December in <mask> .
Interfax said the discussions were being held in parallel with peace talks mediated by the Organisation <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> ( OSCE ) and the broad-based Minsk <mask> of countries led by <mask> and <mask> .
Sombre mood on Arctic island after plane crash .
Rolf <mask>
<mask> , <mask> 1996-08-30
The windblown , chilly streets of this tiny Arctic town are all but deserted and flags are flying at half-mast beneath a brooding , clouded sky .
<mask> is a town in mourning , a close-knit community that has been shattered .
Disaster struck on Thursday when a Russian airliner bringing coal miners to work crashed as it came in to land at the airport , killing all 141 people on board .
" It 's a sight I will never forget .
I will remember it for the rest of my life , " said Stig <mask> .
He was one of a handful of rescuers who raced to the scene of the crash in a helicopter on Thursday , hoping in vain to find survivors .
The plane smashed into a snow-capped mountain on the Arctic island of <mask> on Thursday , just east of <mask> .
" Imagine a big plane with a lot of luggage and people on board .
Think of all that mixed together , with twisted , wrecked parts on the slope , " <mask> , 29 , told Reuters .
Police and local officials have sealed off the crash site , protecting it from intrusive reporters and from the polar bears that roam freely across the icy expanses .
The dead were all Russians and Ukrainians , coming to work in the mining towns of <mask> and <mask> .
<mask> is a Norwegian settlement of just over 1,000 people , but it also feels the loss keenly .
" I have trouble finding the words to express my grief .
It 's a tragedy for everyone .
We know many of the people who live in <mask> , some of them could have been on the plane , " said Johan <mask> , 52 .
Sletten , a caretaker who has lived on the island for 30 years , said the Norwegian and Russian communities visit frequently , competing at soccer in the summer and with snow-scooter races in the winter .
Teenage shop assistant Heidi <mask> was blunter .
" I 'm glad it was not a Norwegian plane , " she said . "
Just think of it -- a mining village where so many workers die .
They must be having a tough time of it now . "
<mask> , just a few hours ride by snow-scooter or 15 minutes by helicopter from <mask> , has asked to be left alone with its grief and told reporters to stay away .
Around 100 Russian and Ukrainian miners were waiting in <mask> to fly home on the plane that crashed .
They were given shelter in the town 's church overnight and ate a sombre breakfast before getting on a bus for the airport .
Another plane had been sent from <mask> to pick them up .
At this time of year , the only colour in <mask> comes from the brightly-painted wooden houses .
Everything else is muddy , the waters of the fjord leaden .
Winter is in the air .
<mask> is an even grimmer place , a run-down testament to the hardships of the new <mask> .
<mask> lies some 500 miles ( 800 km ) off the northern tip of <mask> and endures one of the most extreme climates on the planet .
Inhabited by fewer than 3,000 people in total , it sees the sun for 24 hours a day during summer and is plunged into round-the-clock darkness in the winter months .
The terrain is mountainous , the only roads are dirt tracks .
<mask> rules the island group under the terms of a 1920s international treaty which gave many other nations the right to establish setttlements and exploit the coal that is still mined there .
Only <mask> has chosen to do so .

The Palestinian letter from Marwan <mask> said the destruction of the <mask> centre was an effort by <mask> to " alter the character , demographic composition and status of the <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> " and violated agreements between <mask> and the Palestinian <mask> <mask> .

" We expect the international community to take a clear and firm position , based on international law and in accordance with U.N. resolutions , against all such Israeli violations and illegal practices , " he said .

SOCCER - REAL SCRAPE 1-1 DRAW IN SCRAPPY OPENING MATCH .
<mask> <mask> , <mask> 1996-08-31
A late goal by newly-signed defender Roberto <mask> saved the blushes of Real <mask> coach Fabio <mask> and his multi-billion peseta line-up in the opening game of the Spanish championship on Saturday .
The Brazilian 's 79th-minute effort was enough to earn Real a point from a scrappy 1-1 draw at fellow title contenders Deportivo <mask> .
Deportivo started strongly , taking the lead midway through the first half when former Auxerre playmaker Corentine <mask> headed home a corner after a flick-on by Brazilian-born Spanish international midfielder Donato .
Real looked to be in deep trouble shortly after the break when Luis <mask> was sent off for committing two bookable offences in as many minutes .
But Deportivo were unable to capitalise on their numerical advantage , and were themselves reduced to ten men when Armando <mask> was sent off 15 minutes from time .
Shortly afterwards Roberto <mask> found space in the home defence and equalised for Real with a shot that was deflected past despairing Deportivo ' keeper Jacques <mask> .
In a frantic final five minutes there were chances at both ends , and Donato , who had earlier been booked , was sent off for protesting about the incursion of Real players at a free kick .
Before the match Deportivo chairman Augusto <mask> said he would ignore a FIFA decision banning Brazilian midfielder Mauro <mask> from playing in the match for failing to join his national side 's tour of <mask> .
In the event , coach John <mask> decided not to use Silva , who had claimed he did not join the <mask> squad because he had lost his passport .

Derbyshire , nine-wicket winners over Worcestershire , and Surrey , who thrashed Warwickshire by an innings and 164 runs , can instead take the day off along with rivals Leicestershire , who beat Somerset inside two days .

" We took three absolutely brilliant catches in this match and our catching all season has been pretty impressive .
Our catching will win or lose us the championship , " he said .

RUGBY <mask> - SPRINGBOKS FINALLY BREAK ALL <mask> SPELL .
Andy <mask>
<mask> 1996-08-31
<mask> <mask> managed to avoid a fifth successive defeat in 1996 at the hands of the All <mask> with an emphatic 32-22 victory in front of an ecstatic <mask> <mask> crowd on Saturday .
They scored three tries in recording their highest total against <mask> <mask> , salvaging some pride in a season in which the world champions have lost five out of eight tests .
It also ended a run of nine successive victories this year for <mask> <mask> but arrived too late to prevent a 2-1 series defeat and an historic first All <mask> series triumph on South <mask> soil .
Springbok scrum-half Joost <mask> <mask> <mask> was his side 's inspiration , scoring their opening try and making the third for flanker Andre <mask> from a quickly taken penalty to give his side a 29-8 lead after 54 minutes .
Fullback Andre <mask> scored the other , scorching in from 40 metres at the start of the second half to add to his three long-range penalties .
The All <mask> salvaged some pride by scoring two tries from centre Walter <mask> and scrum-half Justin <mask> in the final five minutes to close a gap which at one point stood at 24 points .
But they generally endured an off-day , highlighted by recalled fly-half Andrew <mask> who missed five out of eight kicks at goal .
Recalled fly-half Henry <mask> kicked the Springboks into a 6-0 lead after 10 minutes only to see Andrew <mask> launch a penalty from eight metres inside his own half to narrow the gap .
Mehrtens missed three further penalties and a conversion in the first 40 minutes which could have put his side ahead , but it was the Springboks who looked the more dangerous .
Their promise was realised when Joubert made a 40-metre break in the 25th minute and , although winger Pieter <mask> appeared to knock on Joubert 's reverse pass , Welsh referee Derek <mask> allowed Van <mask> <mask> to pick up and score under the posts .
Honiball converted and Joubert kicked a penalty before All <mask> hooker Sean <mask> scored a try from close range on the stroke of half-time to narrow the lead to 16-8 and hint at a comeback .
Instead Joubert kicked another long penalty and then raced around the outside of the defence to score the Springboks ' second try .
A quick penalty from Van <mask> <mask> five metres from the All <mask> line set up the third try for Venter five minutes later and when Joubert kicked his third penalty the Springboks held an unassailable 32-8 lead going into the last quarter .
When the All <mask> did break through , it was too late .
Centre Walter <mask> followed up Mehrtens ' kick to score under the posts and scrum-half Justin <mask> forced himself over from a ruck close to the line in injury-time to give them some consolation .

SQUASH - HILL BRANDS WORLD CHAMPION JANSHER A CHEAT .
<mask> <mask> 1996-08-31
Controversial Australian Anthony <mask> called Jansher <mask> a cheat during his acrimonious defeat by the world number one in the Hong <mask> <mask> semifinals on Saturday .
The match boiled over when Hill made to walk off court after what he claimed was a game-winning point in the third .
When the referee called Jansher 's return good and the decision was accepted by the player , Hill shrieked at the Pakistani : " You cheat . "
" He was standing right there and knew the shot was down so I called him a cheat , " said Hill , whose squash career has been blighted by fines and suspensions for unacceptable behaviour .
" He knew it was down and accepted what I called him because of that . "
Hill won the game on the next point and said later that Jansher was generally honest on court but played by the referee 's decision .
The Australian had upset Jansher 's rhythm with his mixture of gamesmanship and fluent stroke-making but eventually succumbed 15-7 17-15 14-15 15-8 .
" I changed my strategy against him today and had him rattled , " he added .
He is not as fit as he used to be be but was too good for me in the end .
I shook him a bit but he will come out next time and be a better player for it -- that 's Jansher . "
Jansher said that he was disturbed to be called a cheat . "
What he did was bad for squash , bad for the crowd and bad for the sponsors .
" We are trying to build up squash like tennis and players should not say things like that .
" I think the Professional <mask> <mask> should look into this matter and deal with it properly .
I am not calling for him to be banned but they have to take some action . "
Jansher , bidding for an eighth Hong <mask> <mask> title , plays second-seeded Australian Rodney <mask> in the final .
Eyles played his best squash of the tournament to beat fourth-seeded Peter <mask> of <mask> 15-10 8-15 15-10 15-4 .
Eyles , who defeated Jansher in the semifinals of the Portuguese <mask> in 1993 , said that he would like to win for the good of the game .
" I have nothing against Jansher but it will be great if I could beat him , " said Eyles . "
My biggest problem against Jansher is concentration .
I want to beat him so badly that I just cannot get it together . "

GOLF - PARNEVIK TAKES ONE-SHOT LEAD AT GREATER <mask> <mask> .
<mask> , <mask> 1996-08-31
Jesper <mask> of <mask> fired a course record-tying eight-under-par 63 Saturday to take a one-shot lead into the final round of the $ 1.2 million Greater <mask> <mask> .
Parnevik , who is seeking his first PGA <mask> victory , moved to 19-under 194 for the tournament .
Parnevik tied the 18-hole record set by Loren <mask> in 1994 at the <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> and also equalled Saturday by Greg <mask> .
Nolan <mask> , who led by two strokes entering the third round , carded a four-under 67 and was one stroke back at 18-under 195 .
He is striving for his fourth career PGA <mask> victory and first since the 1993 <mask> <mask> .
Tiger <mask> , who made the cut in his first tournament as a professional , shot a two-over-par 73 and was four under for the tournament .
The 20-year-old Woods , who turned professional Tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive U.S. <mask> <mask> , struggled on the front nine , bogeying the first and seventh holes and double-bogeying the par-four , 359-yard ninth hole .
After bogeying the 10th hole to move to four-over for the round , he rallied for birdies on 15 and 18 .
After Parnevik started off his round by parring the first hole and bogeying the second , the Swede birdied six of the next seven holes .
Parnevik continued to storm through the course , birdying three holes on the back nine , including two from 12 feet out on the 15th and 17th holes .
" I ca n't remember when I 've putted this well , " said Parnevik . "
I was disappointed when a 12-footer did n't go in .
" My game feels very good .
I 've been fading my driver but today whenever I set up for a fade it went straight .
Whenever everyone 's making birdies , you never want to be even par . "
Henke had a bogey-free round and birdied four holes , including a 45-footer on the par-three 215-yard seventh hole and one from 12 feet out on the 12th hole .
" I did n't hit it very well today , " said Henke . "
Jasper blew right by me .
Once he did , I knew I had to make birdies just to keep up .
I made some really good pars .
I basically picked up where I left off yesterday afternoon .
" Right now , I ca n't put my finger on what 's wrong . "
Bob <mask> shot a 67 for sole possession of third place at 15-under .
Steve <mask> , who tied for second at last week 's World <mask> <mask> <mask> , and Stuart <mask> were both five shots off the lead at 14 under .
Duffy <mask> , who also tied for second at the World <mask> <mask> <mask> , carded a 70 to lead a group of six golfers at 13 under , including Kraft .
The top four on the PGA <mask> money list all skipped the tournament .
TENNIS - <mask> , <mask> TEAMS OPEN ON ROAD FOR 1997 <mask> <mask> .
Richard <mask>
<mask> <mask> 1996-08-31
This year 's Fed <mask> finalists -- defending champion <mask> and the <mask> <mask> -- will hit the road to open the 1997 women 's international team competition , based on the draw conducted Saturday at the U.S. <mask> .
<mask> travels to <mask> , while the <mask> team heads to the <mask> for first-round matches March 1-2 .
The other two first-round ties will pit hosts <mask> against the <mask> <mask> and visiting <mask> against <mask> .
The semifinals are July 19-20 , and the final September 27- 28 .
Life on the road this year did not slow the Americans , who will try to avenge their 3-2 defeat in the final last year when they host <mask> on September 28-29 in <mask> <mask> .
" Last year we stood on the court after we had lost and we put out hands together and made it our committment to bring back the Cup , " <mask> captain Billie <mask> <mask> said at the draw . "
That is our sole goal . "
The <mask> <mask> edged <mask> in <mask> 3-2 in the opening round in April , and then blanked <mask> 5-0 in <mask> last month in the semifinals .
The victory against <mask> marked the Fed <mask> debut of Monica <mask> , who became a naturalised <mask> citizen in 1994 .
Seles easily won both her singles matches and King is counting on the co-world number one to lead the team again .
" I told Monica we need her if we want to win , " King said .
Seles 's sore left shoulder and a wrist injury to Fed <mask> veteran Mary <mask> <mask> have forced King to take a wait and see attitude regarding her squad for the best-of-five match .
Fernandez was forced to withdraw from the U.S. <mask> .
" We will wait until the last minute so we check with everybody and their injuries , " said King . "
What we like would be Seles , ( Olympic champion Lindsay ) Davenport and Mary <mask> <mask> . "
If she can get that threesome together , King will feel good about her chances against the <mask> 's formidable duo of Arantxa <mask> <mask> and Conchita <mask> .
" To be a great coach you have to have the right horses and I got the right horses , " said King .

The guys say it moved more than everyone in the league .

TENNIS - EDBERG REFUSES TO QO QUIETLY .
Richard <mask>
<mask> <mask> 1996-08-30
Refusing to go quietly in the night , Stefan <mask> extended his stay at his 14th and last U.S. <mask> when Bernd <mask> , trailing and hurting , quit in the fourth set of their second-round match Friday .
The 30-year-old Edberg , a former two-time Open champion , had wrestled control of the match away from Karbacher when the German , hampered by a left hamstring injury , decided he could n't continue under the stadium lights at the <mask> <mask> <mask> .
" A win is a win .
I 'll take it , " Edberg , who has announced that this will be his last Grand <mask> event , said of the 3-6 6-3 6-3 1-0 victory .
Ironically , Karbacher two years ago ended Ivan <mask> 's Grand <mask> career here when the former champion had to retire in the middle of their first-round match .
After seeing the trainer come out early in the third set , Edberg was not surprised by Karbacher 's decision not to go on .
" I knew he had problems with something , " Edberg said . "
I really was n't surprised . "
Edberg had his own problems early in the match as the Swede battled to acclimate himself to the nighttime conditions while Karbacher was ripping passing shots and blasting serves past him .
" I did n't really feel good to begin with , I had problems finding the timing on the ball , seeing the ball , " said Edberg , who upset Wimbledon champion and fifth-seeded Richard <mask> in the first round .
" This was one of these matches where I did n't play up to my standard .
I had to fight hard . "
Edberg 's tenacity paid off in the second set .
Edberg lost his own serve twice , but he rallied for three breaks of his own , the last to wrap up the set .
" That 's where the match sort of changed , " said Edberg . "
I think once I got that second set , I felt a lot better about my game . "
Edberg is starting to feel pretty good about postponing his swan song a lot longer .
" It does n't look all that bad , " Edberg said of his path through the draw starting next with a match against Krajicek 's Dutch countryman Paul <mask> .
However , the 1991 and 1992 champion is not ready to start making plans to be in next week 's final .
" I 'm always being realistic , " said Edberg . "
Like I said many times , I think it 's a very little chance , but nothing is impossible .
If I play great tennis , that could take me a long way .
" A lot of things can happen , like tonight . "

SOCCER - <mask> DOMINATE <mask> IN WORLD <mask> QUALIFIER .
Steve <mask>
<mask> 1996-08-31
<mask> dominated their World <mask> group four qualifier against <mask> on Saturday with wave after wave of attacks but were unable to penetrate the visitors ' defence and had to settle for a goalless draw .
<mask> , who thrashed <mask> 5-1 in their opening group four match , were unable to repeat their performance .
<mask> 's best chance came in the 63rd minute with Stephan <mask> of SC <mask> taking advantage of a scramble in the Scottish penalty area but his shot narrowly passing the left-hand post .
They also went close a minute before the interval when a promising attack saw the ball fall to Markus <mask> but he hit his shot wide .
Everton 's Duncan <mask> went close for <mask> in the 65th minute when he forced Austrian goalkeeper Michael <mask> to a diving save .
Two <mask> players were shown yellow cards , captain Gary <mask> for bringing down Andreas <mask> and Ferguson for arguing against the referee 's decision .
" The result is acceptable , " Scottish coach Craig <mask> told reporters . "
We 'd hoped not to lose and we tried not to play for a draw but the Austrian defence was simply too good . "
SK <mask> 's Dietmar <mask> , who gave an impressive performance , said the team started off well but let the game slip after the first 30 minutes .
" Somehow it seemed there were less than 11 players on the pitch .
We have lost two points .
The Scots are not really a great team and we should have won , " he said .
Austrian coach Herbert <mask> said his team had displayed great fighting spirit but sometimes lacked ideas .
Teams :
<mask> : Michael <mask> , Markus <mask> , Peter <mask> , Anton <mask> , Wolfgang <mask> , Stephan <mask> , Dieter <mask> ( Andreas <mask> 77th ) , Dietmar <mask> , Anton <mask> ( ( Herfried <mask> 68th ) , Andreas <mask> , Andreas <mask> .

<mask> 1996-08-31
Euro <mask> absentee Nicolas <mask> and Youri <mask> scored the goals as 1998 World <mask> hosts <mask> beat <mask> 2-0 in a friendly international on Saturday .
The victory extended to 29 matches <mask> 's unbeaten run under coach Aime <mask> , their Euro <mask> semifinal elimination having come in a penalty shoot-out , but was marred by the sending-off of Chelsea central defender Franck <mask> .
Leboeuf was dismissed two minutes from time for a second bookable offence , fouling Mexican substitute Ricardo <mask> who minutes earlier had also been shown the yellow card for pushing the Chelsea defender in the back .
Both goals came early in the second half after <mask> had surprised the Mexicans with three half-time substitutions .
After a sterile first half , <mask> injected more sting in midfield with the introduction of Juventus 's Zinedine <mask> .
This allowed Djorkaeff to play further up and his cross from the right fell for Ouedec , who has joined Espanyol of <mask> from Nantes since missing the European championship finals through injury , to score after a mistake by midfielder Joaquin <mask> <mask> .
Within four minutes Ouedec was returning the compliment for Djorkaeff , playing a one-two with the Internazionale <mask> forward down the middle to set him up for a cross shot past diving goalkeeper Osvaldo <mask> .
Jacquet , beginning the 22-month countdown to <mask> 's hosting of the World <mask> finals , said : " We have an identity ( as a team ) which we are going to work on . "

SOCCER - <mask> SCRAPE PAST <mask> DESPITE CROWD TROUBLE .
Bert <mask>
<mask> 1996-08-31
<mask> kicked off their 1998 <mask> <mask> campaign with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over 10-man <mask> in a tense match marred by Turkish crowd trouble shortly after the break .
Turkish fans , upset at their team 's 2-0 first-half deficit , ripped apart dozens of plastic seats and threw them over the fence .
Riot police took 10 minutes to restore order .
The police were given an unexpected hand by second-half substitute Sergen <mask> who rekindled Turkish hopes in the 61st with a splendid half-volley which stunned Belgian goalkeeper Filip <mask> <mask> .
But Yalcin , who had come on just four minutes earlier , turned from hero to villain barely two minutes after his strike when he was sent off after spitting at an opponent and arguing with English referee David <mask> .
Marc <mask> had opened the scoring for <mask> after 13 minutes , whacking a low 10-metre drive into the net after an incisive pass by defender Dirk <mask> from the edge of the penalty area .
Brazilian-born Luis <mask> then gleefully slipped the ball past goalkeeper Rustu <mask> from the right of the area to make it 2-0 seven minutes before the interval , <mask> 's best first-half effort proving to be a vicious 30-metre shot by Ogun <mask> which De <mask> tipped over .
The visitors , seeking to restore some pride after failing to score a single goal in Euro <mask> in June , repeatedly ripped through the left side of the home defence but De <mask> was able to block several sharply-angled efforts .
With only the group seven winners qualifying automatically for the 1998 finals in <mask> , <mask> could not afford a slip-up at home and they frantically chased a decisive third goal .
But they were almost upset 12 minutes from time when De <mask> fumbled a hard Arif <mask> shot and Orhan <mask> almost pounced on the loose ball .
<mask> 's best second-half effort came three minutes later when Degryse put the ball over the bar from close range with Recber beaten .
Teams :
<mask> - 1 - Filip <mask> <mask> , 2 - Bertrand <mask> , 3 - Dirk <mask> , 4 - Pascal <mask> , 16 - Geoffrey <mask> , 6 - Gunther <mask> ( 15 - Nico <mask> <mask> , 81st ) , 10 - Enzo <mask> , 7 - Gert <mask> ( 14 - Frederic <mask> , 62nd ) , 9 - Marc <mask> , 8 - Luc <mask> , 11- Luis <mask> ( 18 - Gilles <mask> <mask> , 88th ) .
<mask> - 1 - Rustu <mask> , 4 - Hakan <mask> ( 14 - Sergen <mask> , 57th ) , 2 - Recep <mask> , 3 - Ogun <mask> , 5 - Alpay <mask> , 7- Abdullah <mask> , 6 - Tolunay <mask> , 10 - Oguz <mask> ( 13 - Arif <mask> , 57th ) , 11 - Tayfun <mask> , 9 - Hakan <mask> , 8 - Saffet <mask> ( 17- Orhan <mask> , 76th ) .
Belgian coach Wilfried <mask> <mask> said he had not expected <mask> to be so strong and fast .
" We started panicking a bit after the Turkish goal ...
we suffered , " said Van <mask> , who succeeded Paul <mask> <mask> as coach in April .
It was <mask> 's first victory under Van <mask> after two draws in friendlies against <mask> and <mask> .

BOXING - KNOCK-OUT SPECIALIST MILLER DEFENDS TITLE .
<mask> 1996-08-31
A powerful right hook followed by a straight left gave defending champion Nate <mask> a seventh round knock-out win over fellow American James <mask> in their WBA cruiserweight title bout on Saturday .
Miller , who went into the contest with a record of 24 knock-out wins in 32 fights , took charge from the opening bell and had his opponent on the canvas inside 90 seconds when he landed a deft left-hook to the head .
Heath did score with two brusing lefts to Miller 's head in the third round but failed to put his opponent under any real pressure .
Miller raised the pace of the contest at the start of the fifth round and , once he started to get his right-left combinations working for him , the fight was never likely to go the distance .

Paper says Thatcher 's office consulted astrologer .
<mask> 1996-09-01
A British newspaper said Margaret <mask> was so shaken by an IRA attempt on her life when she was prime minister in 1984 that an astrologer was asked to warn her against future threats .
The <mask> <mask> quoted Majorie <mask> as saying she did a horoscope chart for Thatcher , a Libran , after she narrowly escaped death in the Irish guerrilla bombing of a hotel during the Conservative <mask> conference more than a decade ago .
Orr said Thatcher 's press secretary Bernard <mask> asked her to telephone if she saw any threatening indications in the future .
" Bernard <mask> told me that if I ever heard anything that indicated danger I was to let him know , " Orr said .
Orr said she never had to telephone .
She added that the horoscope was purely for security purposes and she was never consulted about political moves .
Ingram was quoted as telling the newspaper he thought astrology was " a load of rubbish " and that he could not recall asking Orr to keep a watch on Thatcher 's stars .
Thatcher , dubbed the " Iron <mask> " for her driven , forceful personality , was never known to have an interest in the occult and in fact has a university degree in chemistry .
Former <mask> president Ronald <mask> 's wife , Nancy , admitted in her biography My <mask> that she regularly consulted an astrologer to help her plan her husband 's schedule .

British <mask> <mask> leader Tony <mask> won a narrow victory on Saturday when the party 's Scottish executive voted 21-18 in favour of his plans for a referendum on a separate parliament for <mask> .
Blair once pledged to set up a Scottish parliament if the Labour won the next general election , which must be held by May 1997 .
But many activists were dismayed when he abruptly decided earlier this year to hold a two-question referendum on the issue , asking Scots if they wanted a separate parliament and if it should have tax-raising powers .
Many party members argued that a general election win would demonstrate popular support for a separate parliament and others said a single question referendum would suffice .
Prime Minister John <mask> says the 300-year-old union of the Scottish and English parliaments will be a main plank in his Conservative <mask> 's election platform .
Conservatives have only 10 of the 72 Scottish seats in parliament and consistently run third in opinion polls in <mask> behind Labour and the independence-seeking Scottish <mask> <mask> .

S. <mask> Afrikaners still seek own territory .
<mask> <mask> 1996-08-31
South <mask> right-wing Afrikaners on Saturday revived their campaign for a form of self-rule , identifying a sparsely-populated area in <mask> <mask> province as the best place for a home of their own .
Constand <mask> , leader of the Freedom <mask> party , told a news conference in <mask> self-determination for Afrikaners could begin at local government level .
" Certain powers can be delegated from the provincial level , towards the sub-regions , " he said .
" We think that the Afrikaner model within this new , multi- ethnic society of <mask> <mask> will have to develop experimentally with world thinking in this regard . "
Viljoen broke with other right-wing whites in 1994 by taking part in the country 's first all-race elections in April of that year , saying the only way to attain self-determination was by cooperating with President Nelson <mask> 's majority African <mask> <mask> .
Some right-wingers demanded sovereignty in their own territory in the run-up to the elections , saying the alternative was war .
Their threats came to nothing .
Viljoen has hailed clauses in <mask> <mask> 's new constitution as making possible a form of self-rule for the Afrikaners , descendants of the country 's Dutch , German and French settlers .
According to state television , Viljoen told the news conference the self-rule model should be introduced in parts of the <mask> <mask> provinces where a majority of people -- whites and mixed-race Coloureds -- speak Afrikaans .
Rwandan refugee group calls for calm over census .
<mask> 1996-08-31
A Rwandan refugee lobby group called on Saturday for calm in refugee camps in eastern <mask> during a census from Sunday to be conducted by aid workers .
The Rally <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> ( RDR ) urged the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to avoid any " policing approach " and to calm refugees by explaining the aims of the operation .
" The RDR appeals to all refugees to prepare themselves calmly for the demands of the census agents because it will be in their ultimate interest , " the group said in a statement .
It said refugees feared census takers would use indelible ink to mark them so they could be detected by Rwandan government troops and mistreated if they were forced back into <mask> .
U.N. officials said more than 1,000 aid workers will take part in the census from Sunday until Tuesday of the estimated 727,000 refugees in camps around the eastern Zairean border town of <mask> .
Only about 100 refugees a week are returning voluntarily to <mask> in contrast to the 600 babies born in the camps weekly .
Zairean Prime Minister Kengo <mask> <mask> said at the end of a visit to <mask> last week that the Zairean and Rwandan governments agreed on an " organised , massive and unconditional repatriation " of the 1.1 million Rwandan refugees in <mask> .
He said the repatriation would be carried out swiftly and would be enormous , starting with the closure of refugee camps .
RDR said it feared forced expulsions would start in days .
Zairean troops expelled 15,000 refugees in August last year .
Many of the 1.1 million Rwandan Hutu refugees in <mask> and nearly 600,000 in <mask> refuse to go home , saying they fear reprisals for the 1994 genocide in <mask> of up to a million people by Hutus .
NATO monitors Moslem move towards tense village .
<mask> , <mask> 1996-08-31
NATO said it was closely monitoring the movement of about 75 Moslem men towards the village of <mask> in <mask> 's Serb republic on Saturday , two days after a violent confrontation with Serbs .
" I have to report this morning that we have in fact received reports ...
that up to 75 Moslem men are believed to be approaching <mask> , " NATO spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Max <mask> said in <mask> .
Marriner said that NATO troops had set up a checkpoint on the road between <mask> and <mask> to establish the identities and intentions of the men headed towards the village .
<mask> is a Moslem village on Bosnian <mask> republic territory .
Moslems were driven from the village during the 43- month Bosnian war and most of their houses were destroyed .
Some Moslems began returning to rebuild their properties earlier in the week .
Fights and shooting broke out between the Moslems and Serb police on Thursday and NATO troops finally brought restored order .
A Reuters reporter who entered <mask> on Saturday morning found it tranquil but NATO troops and U.N. police were seen on the ground and NATO helicopters flew overhead .
Chechens exuberant but cautious on peace deal .
Liutauras <mask>
<mask> , <mask> 1996-08-31
Crowds of pro-independence Chechens greeted a newly-signed peace deal by singing , dancing and firing guns in the air on Saturday , but the celebrations held a trace of uncertainty .
More than a thousand women , children and men gathered in a field to the north of the town of <mask> on Saturday to wait for a column of rebels to withdraw from the capital <mask> about 25 km ( 12 miles ) away .
The men fired weapons into the air as groups of women danced .
Adults in the crowd carried posters of former Chechen leader Dzhokhar <mask> -- who declared independence in 1991 -- and children , carrying photographs of him , called " Troops out ! "
.
Russian military officials have expressed fears that the rebels and their supporters will see the deal signed by Russian peace envoy Alexander <mask> in the early hours of Saturday as a military victory for the separatists .
It involves the withdrawal of Russian troops sent to <mask> in December 1994 to crush the separatists and a postponement of the issue at the heart of the conflict -- the status of the mainly-Moslem <mask> <mask> region .
But the people in the crowd on Saturday , who had turned out in support of the rebels , did not seem sure that the war was over .
" We hope for the best , that it really has ended so we can live in peace .
It 's our only dream , " said a 30-year-old woman , Mubatik <mask> .
Aiza <mask> , with her 10-year-old son beside her , shared the guarded optimism . "
We really want the war to end , we hope and believe that our sons and brothers will win , " said Dudayeva , adding that she was from <mask> .
<mask> is a traditionally anti-separatist pocket in <mask> and Moscow-backed leader Doku <mask> , who has been sidelined in the peace deal , has warned that it and places like it could become centres of civil war if Russian troops leave .
But on Saturday the people gathered just outside the town seemed to be united in favour of the separatists .
Two columns of rebels appeared in jeeps and cars , firing their guns in the air , as the crowd rushed towards them .
Mouldi <mask> , in his late 20 's , dressed in black and carrying a machine gun , was welcomed by his mother and sister .
" Two sons have come back , " said his mother Nurbika <mask> . "
It 's the end .
We believe in God . "
Mamatuyev joked that his sister Lisa was a rebel too , and she responded by grabbing hold of his gun and shouting the Chechen war cry " Allahu <mask> " ( God is Greatest ) and " Freedom for <mask> ! "
.
The fighter , sitting next to a man dressed in green and carrying a grenade-launcher , said that the strict Islamic law adopted by the rebels during the conflict was now needed to impose peace .
" The war has ended if everything works out , if there is law there will be power .
Only Sheriat ( Islamic law ) can end the war . "
Polish group to bid for Ruch newsstand chain - paper .
<mask> 1996-08-31
A Polish consortium including the Bank <mask> <mask> <mask> ( BRE ) plans to rival <mask> 's Hachette in bidding for Polish state-owned press distribution chain Ruch <mask> , Zycie <mask> daily said on Saturday .
Zycie <mask> said its own publisher , mineral water firm Multico , and a group headed by Polish businessman Zygmunt <mask> were forming a consortium which would offer about $ 120 million , with finance provided by BRE .
The consortium wanted 40 percent of Ruch 's shares , the state would get 20 percent of Ruch and 40 percent would be offered on the <mask> stock exchange .
" This division would guarantee a dispersal of capital , preventing anyone from taking total control over Ruch and dictating market conditions , " the paper quoted one of the initiators of the move as saying , without giving a name .
A consortium of press distributor Hachette and Polish publishers group UWP are seeking more than than 50 percent of Ruch and French President Jacques <mask> is likely to support its case when he visits <mask> in September , the daily said .
News-stand chain Ruch , which controls about 65 percent of <mask> 's press distribution market , had a net profit of 16.2 million zlotys on sales of 2.7 billion zlotys in 1995 .
It has about 17,000 news-stands and was the country 's sole press distributor before the 1989 fall of communism .
Zycie <mask> said the new , open consortium , which also included several listed Polish firms , would on Monday inform Privatisation Minister Wieslaw <mask> of its plans .
It aims to invest $ 200 million in Ruch over five years -- more than the sum Ruch says it needs to upgrade its outlets .
Initially <mask> offered up to 75 percent of Ruch but in March Kaczmarek cancelled the tender and offered a minority stake with an option to increase the equity .
Two consortia -- UWP-Hachette and a consortium of a Polish SPC group and Swiss firms -- placed initial bids .
But after the change of tender conditions Swiss investors pulled out and SPC decided to bid jointly with UWP-Hachette .
Kaczmarek said in May he was unhappy that only one investor ended up bidding for Ruch , in which the government was initially offering up to 35 percent of shares with an option to extend the holding after investment promises are fulfilled .

The detention of veteran dissident Wang <mask> showed <mask> 's determination to crush any vestige of dissent during the current profound transitions in the nation 's leadership , a human rights activist said on Saturday .
Xiao <mask> , executive director of the New <mask> group Human <mask> <mask> <mask> , said Wang 's arrest on Friday appeared to be part of the national " Strike <mask> " campaign that has imprisoned thousands and sent hundreds to their death .
Although supposedly aimed at criminals , dozens of human rights activists have been detained in the campaign , which is meant to strengthen the Communist <mask> 's grip on power as senior leader Deng <mask> nears death , Xiao said in an interview .
" <mask> is going through this power transition period .
The authorities are apparently extremely afraid of any political and social discontent , " said Xiao , in <mask> to attend an Amnesty <mask> conference on human rights in <mask> .
He said one of Wang 's apparent offences was to write a public letter in May suggesting that a free press and an independent judicial system were vital if the government really meant to stamp out rampant corruption .
Xiao said crushing legitimate dissent was only making the problem worse and one day <mask> would pay a high price .
" Those issues are not going to go away by repression .
You only make things more hidden but potentially more explosive , " he said .
Wang was arrested in the east <mask> city of <mask> by security officers who told the dissident 's family he would be sent to a study class -- a euphemism for coercive ideological reform .
Wang , 45 , was sentenced last month to one year 's " re-education by labour " but was released because of ill-health .
Xiao said conditions in the labour camp were so brutal they drove another activist sentenced with Wang to attempt suicide .
Police beat Wang and his colleague , Chen <mask> , and encouraged other camp inmates to attack them as well , Xiao said .

<mask> 's Suu <mask> says military rulers abuse law .
Deborah <mask>
<mask> 1996-08-31
<mask> 's democracy leader Aung <mask> <mask> <mask> hit out at the government on Saturday for recent arrests and jailing of activists , saying the military abused the law to try to crush the democracy movement .
" The main purpose of this press conference is to make it known to the world that the authorities are misusing the law all the time in order to try to crush the democracy movement , " Suu <mask> told reporters at her <mask> home .
Suu <mask> said at least 61 democracy supporters had been arrested since May , and about 30 of them had been sentenced , most to long prison terms .
In May the government launched a sweeping crackdown on the democracy movement , detaining over 260 members of Suu <mask> 's National <mask> <mask> <mask> ( NLD ) ahead of a party congress .
Most were released but several dozen remain in custody .
The Burmese government last week confirmed the recent sentencing of nine democracy activists who were arrested in the May crackdown , including Suu <mask> 's assistant Win <mask> .
The military government , which in May said it had detained the politicians to prevent anarchy , said the activists were charged with attempting to destroy the peace and stability of the state .
But Suu <mask> disagreed with the methods , saying officials often arrested NLD supporters in the middle of the night , then did not give them the opportunity to defend themselves in trials .
" When our people are tried , they are tried in a very secretive way .
Their families are not told , " she said .
Suu <mask> , who spearheads a campaign for sanctions on <mask> 's government , was under house arrest for six years without being tried before being released in July 1995 .
Several other leading members of the NLD have served prison terms .
The NLD party won a landslide victory in a 1990 election but the State <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> ( SLORC ) , which assumed power in 1988 after crushing pro-democracy demonstrations , never recognised the poll .
" This lack of rule of law is an indication that the authorities are not interested in fair play , " she said . "
They are using a travesty of the law to try and crush our movements and to sentence our people to long terms in prison without proper trial . "
Suu <mask> said once the activists were sentenced , they suffered inhuman conditions and lack of rights in prison .
" Almost all of the prisoners start suffering from various health problems after a couple of years in jail , " she said . "
Some of our people have been in prison for five to six years . "
Most political prisoners are held in <mask> 's <mask> <mask> .
Some who have been released have recounted torture methods like sleep and food deprivation and physical abuse .
" If there are any more instances of death in custody it will be further proof that a prison sentence for political prisoners is sometimes almost the same as a death sentence , " Suu <mask> said .
Hla <mask> , an elected member of parliament for the NLD , died in early August after being at <mask> for six years .
His death came five weeks after James <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> , a close friend of Suu <mask> and Danish honorary consul , died while serving a prison term at <mask> .
Suu <mask> said the government had increased its repression tactics on the democracy movement because it feared the growing popularity of the movement .
But she said she and the NLD would not stop their efforts to bring democracy to <mask> even if it meant more arrests of party members or even herself .
" We will carry on .
Nobody is free from arrest in <mask> . "

Automakers , <mask> agency plan air bag safety ads .
<mask> 1996-08-31
Automakers , suppliers , insurers and the federal government 's auto safety agency Saturday launched a $ 10 million safety awareness campaign aimed at reducing the number of children killed accidentally by air bags in cars and trucks .
Officials said they will work with law enforcement agencies , pediatricians and media to warn parents about the dangers that air bags pose to children and adults not wearing seatbelts .
Since 1993 , 24 children have been killed by the explosive force of automotive air bags , which inflate at speeds up to 200 miles per hour .
The first portion of the campaign involves pickup trucks equipped with billboards that were driving along some of the nation 's busiest interstate highways during the Labor <mask> weekend , including <mask> <mask> on the <mask> <mask> , <mask> <mask> and <mask> in the <mask> and <mask> <mask> in <mask> .
The boards read : " Air Bag Safety : Everyone Buckled , Kids in Back . "
Janet <mask> , executive director of the industry-funded National <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> , said most of the injuries to children occurred because they were not wearing seatbelts .
A child 's chances of being killed in a car accident , whether the vehicle was equipped with an air bag or not , is reduced by 29 percent when they are in the rear seat , she said .
The auto industry was about three to six years away from introducing " smart " air bags with the ability to detect the size and position of an occupant and adjust inflation pressures accordingly .
Current air bags were designed to halt the forward momentum of an average-sized , unbelted adult male , not a small child .
Automakers petitioned the National <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> to allow them to introduce air bags that inflate less aggressively to help reduce unwanted injuries .
" Even if changes are made to airbags today , we 'd still have 20 million vehicles on the road with current technology , " Dewey said . "
The public has n't been getting the message . "

Controversial IRA film screened at <mask> festival .
Vera <mask>
VENICE , <mask> 1996-08-31
Dublin-born director Neil <mask> says he never lost more sleep over a film than over " Michael <mask> " , his controversial epic about the IRA which has its premiere on Saturday at the Venice <mask> <mask> .
The film , starring Liam <mask> and Julia <mask> , recounts the life of Michael <mask> , the Irish <mask> <mask> 's Director of Intelligence who fought for Irish independence from 1919 to 1921 .
Although not due for release in <mask> until early next year , some politicians have already said they feared it would fan sectarian tensions in British-ruled <mask> <mask> .
Jordan defends his decision to make the film , whose screenplay he wrote himself after years of research , saying it was " more about history than any political statement " .
" The film spares neither the Irish nor the British in its depiction of the savagery of the time , " Jordan said in a statement released by Warner <mask> . "
How often has independence been achieved without bloodshed ?
Very rarely . "
Jordan , whose 1992 film " The <mask> <mask> " also came under fire for what was perceived as a sympathetic portrayal of the IRA , said Collins was more than just a revolutionary .
" He developed techniques of guerilla warfare later copied by independence movements around the world , from Mao <mask> in <mask> to Yitzak <mask> in <mask> , " Jordan said .
" Collins would never be a proponent of contemporary terrorism as practised today .
He was a soldier and a statesman and , over time , a man of peace . "
Leeson , the Northern <mask> actor who was nominated for an Oscar for best actor for his performance in " Schindler <mask> <mask> " , plays the lead role in Jordan 's film .
Aidan <mask> portrays Harry <mask> , Collins ' best friend , and rival for the love of Kitty <mask> , played by Roberts .
Much of the film was shot on location in <mask> with Jordan using thousands of its citizens as unpaid extras .
A set , however , was used for the fighting scenes .
Noting that information about Collins was " as mysterious as the existence he maintained " , Jordan said he made some historical assumptions in the film .
" I have made choices about certain events based on my own extensive research into his letters and reported speeches , " he said . "
I wanted to make this a story as accurate as possible without killing it dramatically and I think I have .
It is a very true film . "
One of the assumptions is his interpretation of the murky circumstances surrounding the shooting death of Collins , who had broken with his comrades when he sought a negotiated settlement with <mask> , in an ambush in 1922 .
" I have never lost more sleep over the making of a film than I have over ' Michael <mask> ' , but I 'll never make a more important one , " Jordan said .
" In the life of one person you can tell the events that formed the north and south of <mask> as they are today . "
