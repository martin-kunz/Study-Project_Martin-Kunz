<mask> began the defence of their Asian <mask> title with a lucky 2-1 win against <mask> in a Group C championship match on Friday .
But <mask> saw their luck desert them in the second match of the group , crashing to a surprise 2-0 defeat to newcomers <mask> .
<mask> controlled most of the match and saw several chances missed until the 78th minute when Uzbek striker Igor <mask> took advantage of a misdirected defensive header to lob the ball over the advancing Chinese keeper and into an empty net .
Oleg <mask> made sure of the win in injury time , hitting an unstoppable left foot shot from just outside the area .
The former Soviet republic was playing in an Asian <mask> finals tie for the first time .
Despite winning the Asian <mask> title two years ago , <mask> are in the finals as outsiders .
Two goals from defensive errors in the last six minutes allowed <mask> to come from behind and collect all three points from their opening meeting against <mask> .
Takuya <mask> scored the winner in the 88th minute , rising to head a Hiroshige <mask> cross towards the Syrian goal which goalkeeper Salem <mask> appeared to have covered but then allowed to slip into the net .
It was the second costly blunder by <mask> in four minutes .
Defender Hassan <mask> rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar 's goal .
Nader <mask> had given <mask> the lead with a well-struck header in the seventh minute .
<mask> then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area for most of the game but rarely breached the Syrian defence .
Bitar pulled off fine saves whenever they did .
<mask> coach Shu <mask> said : ' ' The Syrian own goal proved lucky for us .
The Syrians scored early and then played defensively and adopted long balls which made it hard for us . '
'
<mask> , co-hosts of the World <mask> in 2002 and ranked 20th in the world by FIFA , are favourites to regain their title here .
Hosts <mask> play <mask> and <mask> <mask> take on <mask> on Saturday in Group A matches .
All four teams are level with one point each from one game .
RUGBY <mask> - CUTTITTA BACK FOR <mask> AFTER A YEAR .
<mask> 1996-12-06
<mask> recalled Marcello <mask>
on Friday for their friendly against <mask> at <mask> more than a year after the 30-year-old wing announced he was retiring following differences over selection .
Cuttitta , who trainer George <mask> said was certain to play on Saturday week , was named in a 21-man squad lacking only two of the team beaten 54-21 by <mask> at <mask> last month .
Stefano <mask> is out through illness and Coste said he had dropped back row Corrado <mask> , who had been recalled for the <mask> game after five years out of the national team .
Cuttitta announced his retirement after the 1995 <mask> <mask> , where he took issue with being dropped from the <mask> side that faced <mask> in the pool stages .
Coste said he had approached the player two months ago about a comeback .
" He ended the World <mask> on the wrong note , " Coste said .
" I thought it would be useful to have him back and he said he would be available .
I think now is the right time for him to return . "

<mask> , <mask> <mask> <mask> 1996-12-06
Two goals in the last six minutes gave holders <mask> an uninspiring 2-1 Asian <mask> victory over <mask> on Friday .
Takuya <mask> headed the winner in the 88th minute of the group C game after goalkeeper Salem <mask> spoiled a mistake-free display by allowing the ball to slip under his body .
It was the second Syrian defensive blunder in four minutes .
Defender Hassan <mask> rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar 's goal .
<mask> had taken the lead from their first serious attack in the seventh minute .
Nader <mask> headed a cross from the right by Ammar <mask> into the top right corner of Kenichi <mask> 's goal .
<mask> then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area and had a goal disallowed for offside in the 16th minute .
A minute later , Bitar produced a good double save , first from Kazuyoshi <mask> 's header and then blocked a Takagi follow-up shot .
Bitar saved well again from Miura in the 37th minute , parrying away his header from a corner .
<mask> started the second half brightly but Bitar denied them an equaliser when he dived to his right to save Naoki <mask> 's low drive in the 53rd minute .

SOCCER - BLINKER BAN LIFTED .
<mask> 1996-12-06
Dutch forward Reggie <mask> had his indefinite suspension lifted by FIFA on Friday and was set to make his Sheffield <mask> comeback against Liverpool on Saturday .
Blinker missed his club 's last two games after FIFA slapped a worldwide ban on him for appearing to sign contracts for both Wednesday and Udinese while he was playing for Feyenoord .
FIFA 's players ' status committee , meeting in <mask> , decided that although the Udinese document was basically valid , it could not be legally protected .
The committee said the Italian club had violated regulations by failing to inform Feyenoord , with whom the player was under contract .
Blinker was fined 75,000 Swiss francs ( $ 57,600 ) for failing to inform the Engllsh club of his previous commitment to Udinese .

Leeds ' <mask> under-21 striker Lee <mask> was fined 4,500 pounds ( $ 7,400 ) on Friday for hurling chairs at restaurant staff during a disturbance at a McDonald <mask> fast-food restaurant .
Bowyer , 19 , who was caught in the act by security cameras , pleaded guilty to a charge of affray at a court in <mask> .
He was fined and ordered to pay a total of 175 pounds to two members of staff injured in the fracas in an east <mask> restaurant in October .
Leeds had already fined Bowyer 4,000 pounds ( $ 6,600 ) and warned him a repeat of his criminal behaviour could cost him his place in the side .
Bowyer , who moved to the <mask> club in August for 3.5 million pounds ( $ 5.8 million ) , was expected to play against Middlesbrough on Saturday .

RUGBY <mask> - LITTLE TO MISS CAMPESE FAREWELL .
Robert <mask>
<mask> 1996-12-06
Centre Jason <mask> will miss <mask> 's end-of-tour fixture against the Barbarians at <mask> on Saturday .
Little has opted not to risk aggravating the knee injury which ruled him out of a large chunk of the tour and is replaced by fellow Queenslander Daniel <mask> .
Owen <mask> has recovered from the knocks he took in last weekend 's test against <mask> and retains his place in the back-row ahead of Daniel <mask> .
The Wallabies have their sights set on a 13th successive victory to end their European tour with a 100 percent record but also want to turn on the style and provide David <mask> with a fitting send-off in his final match in Australian colours .
The Wallabies currently have no plans to make any special presentation to the 34-year-old winger but a full house of 75,000 spectators will still gather in the hope of witnessing one last moment of magic .
Campese will be up against a familiar foe in the shape of Barbarians captain Rob <mask> , the man who kicked <mask> to defeat with a last-ditch drop-goal in the World <mask> quarter-final in <mask> <mask> .
" Campo has a massive following in this country and has had the public with him ever since he first played here in 1984 , " said Andrew , also likely to be making his final <mask> appearance .
On tour , <mask> have won all four tests against <mask> , <mask> , <mask> and <mask> , and scored 414 points at an average of almost 35 points a game .
League duties restricted the Barbarians ' selectorial options but they still boast 13 internationals including <mask> full-back Tim <mask> and recalled wing Tony <mask> , plus All <mask> forwards Ian <mask> and Norm <mask> .

Barbarians - 15 - Tim <mask> ( <mask> ) ; 14 - Nigel <mask> ( <mask> ) , 13 - Allan <mask> ( <mask> ) , 12 - Gregor <mask> ( <mask> ) , 11 - Tony <mask> ( <mask> ) ; 10 - Rob <mask> ( <mask> ) , 9 - Rob <mask> ( <mask> ) ; 8 - Scott <mask> ( <mask> ) , 7 - Neil <mask> ( <mask> ) , 6 - Dale <mask> ( <mask> ) , 5 - Ian <mask> ( <mask> <mask> ) , 4 - Craig <mask> ( <mask> ) , 3 - Darren <mask> ( <mask> ) , 2 - Norm <mask> ( <mask> <mask> ) , 1 - Nick <mask> ( <mask> ) .

CRICKET - LARA ENDURES ANOTHER MISERABLE DAY .
Robert <mask>
<mask> 1996-12-06
<mask> gave Brian <mask> another reason to be miserable when they beat <mask> <mask> by five wickets in the opening World <mask> limited overs match on Friday .
Lara , disciplined for misconduct on Wednesday , was dismissed for five to extend a disappointing run of form on tour .
<mask> , who hold a 2-0 lead in the five-match test series , overhauled <mask> <mask> ' total of 172 all out with eight balls to spare to end a run of six successive one-day defeats .
All-rounder Greg <mask> steered his side to a comfortable victory with an unbeaten 57 in 90 balls to the delight of the 42,442 crowd .
Man-of-the match Blewett came to the wicket with the total on 70 for two and hit three fours during an untroubled innings lasting 129 minutes .
His crucial fifth-wicket partnership with fellow all-rounder Stuart <mask> , who scored 21 , added 71 off 85 balls .
Lara looked out of touch during his brief stay at the crease before chipping a simple catch to Shane <mask> at mid-wicket .
<mask> <mask> tour manager Clive <mask> has apologised for Lara 's behaviour on Tuesday .
He ( Lara ) had told <mask> coach Geoff <mask> that wicketkeeper Ian <mask> was unwelcome in the visitors ' dressing room .
The <mask> crowd were clearly angered by the incident , loudly jeering the <mask> <mask> vice-captain as he walked to the middle .
It was left to fellow left-hander Shivnarine <mask> to hold the innings together with a gritty 54 despite the handicap of an injured groin .
Chanderpaul was forced to rely on a runner for most of his innings after hurting himself as he scurried back to his crease to avoid being run out .
<mask> , who arrive in <mask> later this month , are the other team competing in the World <mask> tournament .

CRICKET - LARA SUFFERS MORE AUSTRALIAN TOUR MISERY .
<mask> 1996-12-06
<mask> <mask> batsman Brian <mask> suffered another blow to his Australian tour , after already being disciplined for misconduct , when he was dismissed cheaply in the first limited overs match against <mask> on Friday .
Lara , who earned a stern rebuke from his own tour management after an angry outburst against <mask> wicketkeeper Ian <mask> , scored five to prolong a run of poor form with the bat .
The <mask> <mask> vice-captain struggled for timing during his 36-minute stay at the crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer Tom <mask> straight to Shane <mask> at mid-wicket .
<mask> <mask> were 53 for two in 15 overs when rain stopped play at the <mask> <mask> <mask> after captain Courtney <mask> won the toss and elected to bat .
Lara 's outburst three days ago has clearly turned some of the Australian public against him .
As he walked to the wicket he was greeted by loud jeers from sections of the crowd .
On several occasions during his innings , the crowd joined together in a series of obscene chants against him .
Tour manager Clive <mask> on Wednesday apologised for Lara 's behaviour in confronting <mask> coach Geoff <mask> in the opposition dressing room to protest against his dismissal in the second test on Tuesday .
Lloyd did not say what form the discipline would take .
Lara , who holds the record for the highest score in test and first-class cricket , was unhappy about Healy 's role in the incident and questioned whether the ball had carried to the <mask> keeper .
<mask> went on to win the match at the <mask> <mask> <mask> by 124 runs to take a two-nil lead in the five-test series after Lara failed in both innings .
Lara has yet to score a century since <mask> <mask> arrived in <mask> five weeks ago .
Both <mask> <mask> and <mask> team management have played down the incident , stressing that relations between the two sides have not been adversely affected .
<mask> , who arrive next week , are the third team in the triangular World <mask> tournament .

" A reaction , provoked , cannot erase 10 years of loyalty everywhere and in every competition .
" I will be happy to give him the award personally on January 20 in <mask> and I 'm confident that Costa himself will be there beside me on that day to shake his hand . "

Cagliari start favourite in this relegation scrap following draws with Napoli and Inter in last two outings but will be without suspended Swiss defender Ramon <mask> .
Bottom team Reggiana are also without a suspended defender , German Dietmar <mask> .
Fiorentina ( 10 ) v Perugia ( 8 ) 1330
Fiorentina will be without three suspended players -- defenders Daniele <mask> and Lorenzo <mask> and midfielder Emiliano <mask> -- for a difficult home match against unpredictable , attack-oriented Perugia led by in-form Croat striker Milan <mask> and the experienced Fausto <mask> .
Lazio ( 12 ) v AS <mask> ( 7 ) 1930
Poor man 's Roman derby in what has been a miserable season for both <mask> teams , already eliminated from the Italian and UEFA <mask> .
Lazio have injury doubts about striker Pierluigi <mask> , <mask> midfielder Pavel <mask> and defender Paolo <mask> , while Roma present a full strength side led by Argentine Abel <mask> , Marco <mask> and Francesco <mask> in attack .
AC <mask> ( 9 ) v Udinese ( 11 ) 1330
Can Milan sink any further ?
Following their midweek Champions <mask> <mask> elimination by Norwegian side Rosenborg , a morale-boosting win is badly needed .
Liberian striker George <mask> makes a welcome return for Milan alongside Roberto <mask> , with Montenegrin Dejan <mask> in midfield .
Good news for Milan is that Udinese 's German striker Oliver <mask> is out through injury .
Napoli ( 5 ) v Verona ( 17 ) 1330
In-form Napoli should prove too strong for second from bottom Verona despite the absence of their suspended Argentine defender Roberto <mask> .
Verona 's slim chances have been further reduced by a knee injury to their experienced midfielder Eugenio <mask> .
Parma ( 14 ) v Atlalanta ( 15 ) 1330
Parma may field new signing , Croat midfielder Mario <mask> , in an attempt to lift a miserable season which has seen them go without a win since a 1-0 triumph over Cagliari eight weeks ago .

Atalanta look to Filippo <mask> , scorer of eight goals .
Sampdoria ( 6 ) v Juventus ( 3 ) 1330
All-conquering Juventus field their most recent signing , Portuguese defender Dimas , while Alessandro <mask> <mask> and Croat Alen <mask> lead the attack .
The new world club champions may prove too strong for a Sampdoria side led by captain Roberto <mask> but missing injured French midfielder Pierre <mask> .
Vicenza ( 1 ) v Internazionale ( 2 ) 1330
Not exactly a clash of the titans but an intriuguing match nonetheless .
Full strength Vicenza , led by Uruguayan Marcelo <mask> , may continue their surprise run at the top against an Inter side that has been less than impressive in three successive home draws .
Inter will be without suspended French defender Joceyln <mask> and injured Chilean striker Ivan <mask> .

GUNMEN KILL FOUR IN S.AFRICA 'S ZULU PROVINCE .
DURBAN , <mask> <mask> 1996-12-06
At least four people have been shot dead in two suspected political attacks in <mask> <mask> 's volatile Zulu heartland , police said on Friday .
A police spokesman said two youths believed to be supporters of President Nelson <mask> 's African <mask> <mask> ( ANC ) had been killed when unknown gunmen opened fire at the rural settlement of <mask> on <mask> province 's south coast on Thursday night .
The victims were 18 and 20 , he said , adding one other youth had been wounded in the shooting .
In another attack , also on the province 's south coast on Thursday night , two men were shot dead near <mask> .
" We suspect that these killings are linked to politics , " spokesman Bala <mask> told Reuters .
There had been no arrests .
The killings came just hours after violence monitors said they were not optimistic of a peaceful festive season in <mask> and pointed the south coast region where 18 people were massacred last Christmas as one of potential hot spots .
They said the recent lull in political feuding could be upset as thousands of migrant workers , some tense with grudges brewed in the cities and keen to settle old scores , flock back to their home villages .
More than 14,000 people have lost their lives in over a decade of political turf wars between the ANC and Zulu Chief Mangosuthu <mask> 's Inkatha <mask> <mask> in the province .

<mask> President Vaclav <mask> on Friday welcomed the appointment of Madeleine <mask> , who is of <mask> extraction , as the <mask> <mask> ' first woman Secretary of State .
In a statement Havel , who is recovering from cancer surgery , said : " Madeleine <mask> is a distinguished friend , a tested diplomat , and a true American of fine origins . "
" I look forward to continuing our good relations ...
with the <mask> <mask> and with the first woman ever to hold the position of Secretary of State .
I wish her well , " Havel said in a statement to Reuters .
Havel , who helped lead the " velvet revolution " that ousted the Communist regime in <mask> in 1989 , invited Albright , then working for a private foreign policy think tank , to advise his new democratic government in 1990 .
Havel had a small malignant tumour removed from his lung on Monday and is recovering in hospital .
Albright , born Marie <mask> to a Czechoslovak diplomat in 1937 , fled with her family to the <mask> <mask> after the Communists came to power in a coup in 1948 .
As an academic , Albright studied and lectured on <mask> 's 20th century problems before becoming <mask> ambassador to the United <mask> .
<mask> diplomats , seeking to have their country included in the expected expansion of NATO , praised the selection of Albright , known to be a strong supporter of alliance 's integration of former Soveit-bloc countries .
" The nomination ...
is a clear signal that one key of the lines of foreign policy will be the strengthening of the trans-Atlantic cooperation , a creation of strategic partnership between <mask> and the <mask> , " Foreign Minister Josef <mask> told Reuters .
" ( Albright ) is a convinced advocate of NATO enlargement and of stabilisation of security structures . "
<mask> ambassador to the United <mask> , Karel <mask> , told the daily Mlada <mask> <mask> that Albright " is a little light in our diplomatic heaven , " but warned against expecting her to exert any influence in favour of the Czechs .

CZECH VICE-PM SEES WIDER DEBATE AT PARTY CONGRESS .
<mask> 1996-12-06
Saturday 's national congress of the ruling Czech <mask> <mask> <mask> ( ODS ) will discuss making the party more efficient and transparent , Foreign Minister and ODS vice-chairman Josef <mask> , said on Friday .
" Modernisation and more profesionalism of the party 's structure , having financing of the party be more transparent ...
are absolutely fundamental , " Zieleniec , who is also vice-premier in the government , told Reuters .
He said after June general elections in which the ruling three-party coalition lost its parliamentary majority , the ODS executive , led by Prime Minister Vaclav <mask> , had developed proposals on these subjects to present at the congress on Saturday in the <mask> second city <mask> .
" I am convinced , that the congress will tackle these proposals , " he said .
The ODS , a party in which Klaus often tries to emulate the style of former British Prime Minister Margaret <mask> , has been in control of <mask> politics since winning general elections in 1992 .
Zieleniec in the summer led calls for the party and its leadership to listen to more diverse opinions , a thinly-veiled criticism of Klaus who has spearheaded the country 's post-Communist economic reforms .
The party , led by the vigorously-confident Klaus , took 32 of 81 seats after late November runoff elections to the new upper house of <mask> parliament .
But after the first round vote a week before , the ODS had the potential to win as many 79 seats .
Klaus and his coalition lost its majority in parliament in June lower house elections after the left-wing opposition consolidated , putting the centre-left Social <mask> in a strong second-place position .

<mask> GOT MONEY FROM POST-WAR SWISS ACCOUNTS .
Marcin <mask>
<mask> 1996-12-06
<mask> said on Friday that Swiss bank accounts , which in many cases belonged to Polish Jews who died in the Holocaust , were used in debt settlements between the two countries after the World <mask> <mask> .
Foreign Minister Dariusz <mask> , unveiling first findings of a special government commission , said that in 1970s the then communist <mask> received 460,000 Swiss francs from the accounts .
" In 1970s , <mask> received from unclaimed accounts in <mask> a sum of 460,000 francs .
What was its right ( to the money ) ...I do not know , " Rosati told a news conference .
<mask> stands accused by Senator Alfonse <mask> , chairman of the powerful U.S. <mask> <mask> <mask> , of agreeing to give money to <mask> from unclaimed bank accounts of Polish citizens , as part of an accord on compensating Swiss nationals whose assets had been seized in communist <mask> .
Many of these citizens were Jews murdered during the war , when Nazi German invaders killed most of <mask> 's 3.5 million Jews .
Rosati did not say whether the payment in 1970s was part of the 1949 agreement between <mask> and <mask> on compensation to Swiss citizens whose assets were seized by the Soviet-imposed communists authorities after World <mask> <mask> .
" I expect that the commission will finish gathering information within two to three weeks and then more details will be provided , " Rosati said .
Rosati confirmed that the 1949 agreement had provided for granting <mask> about 53 million francs and most of this sum was repaid with coal exports .
He said , however , that <mask> did get about 16,000 francs from the so-called " dead accounts " as part of the compensation .
" About 16,000 francs were seized from accounts of four or five Polish citizens , whose data we do not precisely know .
The issue is of moral and legal nature , because its financial significance is small , " Rosati said .
Under pressure from international Jewish organisations , Swiss government has devised a plan to pay out millions of dollars in unclaimed bank accounts as a conciliatory gesture toward Holocaust victims .
The conservative Radical <mask> ( FDP ) have said they would ask parliament next week to order Swiss banks to put some 40 million Swiss francs ( $ 31 million ) in dormant wealth into a fund earmarked for Jewish groups and charitable organisations .
But Swiss banks and the country 's Jewish community voiced doubts whether the plan would work .
INTERVIEW-ZYWIEC SEES NO BIG 97 NET RISE .
Steven <mask>
<mask> 1996-12-06
Polish brewer Zywiec 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges , but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share , the firm 's chief executive said .
Company President Jean <mask> <mask> told Reuters in an interview on Friday that the firm , whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales , might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround .
So far this year Zywiec , whose full name is Zaklady <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> , has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys .
It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres .
Van <mask> would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading Polish brewers should rise as the country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer .
" The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable , " van Boxmeer said on Polish per-capita beer consumption , currently around 40 litres .
He said the 65-80-litre level could be reached in the next ten years and make <mask> , with its 40-million population , <mask> 's third largest beer market after <mask> and <mask> .
Van <mask> said <mask> 's top five brewers , which produce about 55 percent of the country 's beer , could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors .
Zywiec is 31.8-percent owned by Heineken while Carlsberg has the same amount in Okocim .
Earlier this year South <mask> <mask> <mask> ( SAB ) bought strategic stakes in the unlisted Lech and Tychy brewers , which together hold more than 20 percent of the market , and <mask> 's Brewpole <mask> has a controlling stake in <mask> 's larges t brewery , Elbrewery <mask> <mask> ( EB ) .
Van <mask> said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation , which had added to the pressure on the firm 's margins .
He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share .
But he said the company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring <mask> <mask> .
Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality <mask> imports could invade <mask> once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998 , but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the <mask> beer market 's overcapacity .
" I think Polish consumers in general are quite proud of their beers -- and I 'm speaking about all the brands -- and as we make good beers ...
I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the <mask> beers , " he said .
Van <mask> said Zywiec had its eye on Okocim , which has said it would start producing Carlsberg beer next year , but that Zywiec 's potential production of Heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one .
He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand , Zywiec Full <mask> , which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country 's largest-selling brand .
" You will not win the war of the Polish beer market with imported international brands , " van Boxmeer said , adding that Heineken would remain an up-market import in <mask> .
Van <mask> also said Zywiec would be boosted by its recent shedding of soft drinks which only accounted for about three percent of the firm 's overall sales and for which 7.6 million zlotys in provisions had already been made .

HAVEL HAS TRAECHEOTOMY AFTER CONDITIONS WORSENS .
<mask> 1996-12-06
Doctors performed an emergency tracheotomy to help <mask> President Vaclav <mask> breathe after cancer surgery on his lungs earlier this week , a spokesman said on Friday .
He said that the procedure to insert a device into Havel 's throat , done after his breathing worsened on Thursday , had helped , and the president 's condition significantly improved .
" A worsening in the president 's lung functions took place yesterday , " presidential spokesman Ladlislav <mask> said in a statement .
" A tracheotomy was performed and supportive breathing was installed through the help of a breathing device , " he said . "
After these steps , the president 's condition signigicantly improved . "
Havel has been recovering from surgery on Monday which removed a small malignant tumour and half of his right lung .
Doctors after the operation said that they had caught the cancer early , and that Havel could fully recover from the surgery within six weeks .
His spokesman said on Thursday that Havel , 60 and a heavy smoker , had also developed a slight case of pneumonia in the left lung .

<mask> sets conditions to clear American alliance .

The British government warned Friday that it would refer the proposed trans-Atlantic alliance between British <mask> <mask> and American <mask> to <mask> 's Monopolies <mask> <mask> <mask> unless the carriers complied with a number of conditions .
Trade <mask> <mask> Secretary Ian <mask> added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines , final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between <mask> and the <mask> <mask> to liberalise trans-Atlantic air traffic , which would create greater competition on the routes .
Lang said he supported conditions proposed by <mask> 's Office <mask> <mask> <mask> , which was asked to examine the case last month .
" I agree ... that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers , on those routes where BA and AA currently compete and for all passengers on the trans-Atlantic market route between the <mask> and <mask> , " he said .
His comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in <mask> with no deal signed .
Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the British <mask> deal would be cleared .
The conditions for clearance of the alliance were that British <mask> and American drop 168 slots at <mask> <mask> airport , the busiest in <mask> .
American 's parent , AMR <mask> , said it did not view the terms as a " deal breaker . "
However , it called the conditions " more severe " than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances .
British <mask> 's initial response was that " unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on the basis of fair market value . "
It added that it would be " prepared to take reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition . "
The government also wants British <mask> to drop a clause in its agreement with USAir that bars it from competing on trans-Atlantic routes , and said both British <mask> and American should be prepared to reduce services on the <mask> to <mask> <mask> route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter .
It also suggested losing some slots on the London-to-Boston route .
The Office <mask> <mask> <mask> called for British <mask> / American to allow third-party access to their joint frequent flyer programme where the applicant does not have access to an equivalent programme .
Lang said responses should be made to the Office <mask> <mask> <mask> by Jan. 10 , 1997 .
Med oil products mostly lower as Elf strike ends .
<mask> 1996-12-06
Mediterranean oil products were steady to mostly lower on Friday after Elf refinery workers voted to end their nine-day strike .
Gas oil erased Thursday 's gains , plunging $ 5.50 a tonne in line with the screen .
Volume was very thin and market remained long , with premiums down $ 1 at about high cif quotes +$0.50 basis Genoa . "
The sharp moves on the screen make everyone nervous , " a trader said .
Trades were discussed in 0.2 , 0.5 and one percent heating oil into <mask> and <mask> and there were fresh inquiries from <mask> and <mask> for low sulphur diesel .
Interest remains focussed on a tender by <mask> for a second purchase of high speed diesel for January delivery .
Fuel oil lost ground sharply with weaker crude , but also suffered from some pricing pressure .
High sulphur cracked fuel lost about $ 3 to $ 109-111 fob Med with several cargoes threatening to overhang the market .
The chance of material heading north , talked earlier this week , may be in jeopardy now since American fuel oil is expected to head transatlantic following outages at two coking units in the <mask> .
Up to 165,000 tonnes of fuel will have to find a new home and with the arbitrage from the <mask> to <mask> open <mask> is a prime candidate .
Low sulphur prices were lower with cif Med pegged in the mid to low $ 140s .
Gasoline prices fell after striking Elf refinery workers voted to go back to work , traders said .
But an open arbitrage to the <mask> and tight Italian supplies after Elf scooped up Med material over the last week , continued to underpin prices into next week .

NYC Jan refunding has its 1st Euro floating rate .
<mask> <mask> 1996-12-06
<mask> <mask> <mask> on Friday said that it planned a $ 775 million refunding for January that will include its first floating rate issue of taxable debt for European investors .
A city official , who declined to be named , explained that Goldman <mask> <mask> , which this summer was demoted to the second tier of the syndicate , proposed the floating rate issue and as a result was promoted to book runner for this offering .
By selling the floating rate debt , the city hopes to establish a benchmark , the city official said , adding that it needed a large deal to accomplish this objective .
The city in late June sold its first issue of Euronotes , a strategy that it says saved it $ 500,000 in interest costs , and it has been trying to build on this strategy of expanding the pool of potential investors since then .
In November , <mask> <mask> <mask> said it became the first <mask> municipality to offer bonds for sale in European markets by competitive bidding as it listed taxable bonds on the London <mask> <mask> .
The refunding planned for January also includes a $ 475 million tax-exempt offering .
No specific date in January has been selected for the debt sale , the official added .

<mask> <mask> speculates about <mask> <mask> savior .

Homestake <mask> <mask> tops <mask> <mask> 's list as the most likely white knight buyer for Santa <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> if Santa <mask> rejects unsolicited suitor Newmont <mask> <mask> .
Santa <mask> is so far mum on the more than $ 2 billion stock swap takeover proposal from Newmont , announced Thursday .
<mask> <mask> , since the bid , has speculated that any deal between Newmont and Santa <mask> would be a " bear hug , " or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor .
Newmont said the companies have had previous contact , though declined to detail the encounters .
Analysts predict Santa <mask> will go to the highest bidder , and that if a rival buyer is found , Newmont may not be able to match its offer .
They said the Santa <mask> deal , which includes desirable <mask> mining territory , would only payoff for Newmont longer term .
Newmont , in fact , will not benefit from the Santa <mask> acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years , which also limits its capacity to raise its offer .
Any deal , friendly or hostile , would almost assuredly be a stock swap , which is necessary to preserve the tax-free , pooling-of-interest accounting , they said .
Analysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out Barrick <mask> <mask> and Bre-X <mask> <mask> as Santa <mask> saviors because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting <mask> 's Busang vast gold deposit .
Placer <mask> <mask> too was considered unlikley because it is focusing on geographic expansion in areas that do match Santa <mask> 's <mask> , <mask> <mask> and <mask> <mask> presence , they said .
A Homestake spokesman was not immediately available to comment on speculation that it tops the list .
Homestake , based in <mask> <mask> , operates gold mines in the <mask> <mask> , <mask> , <mask> and <mask> .
Earnings in 1995 were $ 0.22 per share , or $ 30.3 million , on revenues of $ 746.3 million .
Santa <mask> is headquartered <mask> , <mask> and reported 1995 earnings of $ 0.30 per share , or $ 40 million , on revenues of $ 350 million .
Santa <mask> has mining and exploration operations in <mask> , <mask> , <mask> , <mask> , <mask> , <mask> , <mask> , <mask> , <mask> and <mask> .
PaineWebber analyst Marc <mask> said he lowered his rating on Newmont to neutral from attractive today because if Newmont merged with Santa <mask> , investors would have to wait until the second half of 1998 to realize earnings accretion .
" I think Homestake could come in as a white knight , but how much is someone willing to come in above the Newmont number .
One would have to outbid by at least 15 percent , but there is going to be a ( Santa <mask> ) deal with someone , " he said .
" Longer term , two to three years out , ( a Newmont-Santa <mask> deal ) is positive , it does all the right things .
But in the near-term it is , at worst , neutral , " the analyst added .
Newmont proposed to <mask> <mask> a stock-swap merger at a ratio of 0.33 Newmont shares for each Santa <mask> shares .
In Friday New <mask> <mask> <mask> trade , Newmonth was off 1/2 to 46-5/8 while Santa <mask> added 1/4 to 15-1/8 .
" Newmont said it wants to discuss a friendly deal with Santa <mask> , which is almost always a euphemism for ' We have more money in our pocket , ' " said an arb , referring to a possible sweetened bid from Newmont .
Two other arbs called Newmont 's move a " a 32 cent bid " because there is no formal tender offer , only the proposal letter " mailed " to Santa <mask> 's board .

Multinational commander going back to east <mask> .
Jonathan <mask>
<mask> 1996-12-06
The Canadian general in charge of a multinational force for eastern <mask> said on Friday he was going back to <mask> for more information about the plight of about 165,000 Rwandan refugees adrift in the countryside .
Lieutenant-General Maurice <mask> told a news conference in <mask> his main concern was for a large group of about 150,000 refugees living off the land in a valley about 65 km ( 40 miles ) west of the eastern city of <mask> .
If he decided it was necessary and safe for the aircrew , he would not hesitate to order airdrops of food for the refugees , even against the wishes of the government in <mask> and the Zairean rebels who control much of eastern <mask> , he said .
" Tomorrow I 'm going into <mask> and my intention is to go across into eastern <mask> and try to find out for the second time what the situation is on the ground , " he said .
General Baril saw rebel leader Laurent <mask> in <mask> last week but the rebels told him the crisis was over because most of the Rwandan refugees have already gone home .
The rebels do not want the multinational force to deploy on the ground , for fear it might help the Zairean army regain control of the area .
<mask> opposes airdrops , apparently because the food could fall into the hands of the rebels and their local supporters .
Canadian Defence Minister Doug <mask> said on Thursday that the multinational force would probably not have to make food airdrops or intervene militarily in any major way .
" It does n't look as though they ( airdrops ) are going to be required in any significant way because the NGOs ( non-governmental organisations ) are in that area on the border between <mask> and <mask> , " Young told reporters .
But General Baril said it would be premature to rule out any course of action until he had more information .
" We hope that if the front moves forward or stabilises then we will have access ( to the large group of refugees ) with reconnaissance or humanitarian agencies .
" If they ca n't move because they are too weak , then we will probably consider very seriously using air delivery means ( airdrops ) ...It 's complex , it 's dangerous for the air crew that fly in there and it will have to be absolutely necessary .
If it is necessary , I wo n't hesitate to use it , " he said .
Asked if he would disregard the objections of the Zairean government , he said : " It would have to be in the last resort .
It would have to mean that tens of thousands of lives are in danger .
Do you think that I would have a conscience problem doing it or not at that time ?
And my mandate is also under Chapter Seven to operate in eastern <mask> . "
Under Chapter Seven of the U.N. charter , the Security <mask> has wide powers to preserve peace and security .
" I know their ( the Zairean government 's ) position and I know it 's very delicate and we are very sensitive to their position also , " the general added .
He denied that his contacts , criticised by <mask> , with the Zairean rebels amounted to negotiations .
" I do n't negotiate , " he said . "
I coordinate with those who are holding ground and that 's a wise thing to do .
When we do n't know where the front is , we do n't know what the risk is . "
Baril said that apart from the group of 150,000 , <mask> and British reconnaissance plans had tracked two much smaller groups of refugees -- one of up to 1,000 north of the town of Masisi and one of up to 8,000 on the road from <mask> west to <mask> .
The <mask> office of the medical charity Medecins <mask> <mask> said on Friday that more than 100,000 refugees were trekking northwest from the <mask> area and many of them were now in the town of <mask> .
The general did not mention these refugees , who are on the outer limit of the strip the planes have been checking .

<mask> proposes foreign minister for U.N. post .

A former cabinet minister in <mask> <mask> <mask> and his son were abducted from their home and murdered in growing ethnic violence in the capital <mask> , a government minister said on Friday .
With violence spiralling out of control , <mask> voiced backing for the elected <mask> government but said its troops based in the former colony under defence pacts would not help it combat army mutineers .
" <mask> cannot be involved in the domestic political debate , " President Jacques <mask> told a news conference at the end of a Franco-African summit in <mask> <mask> .
" French troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities , " he said .
Public Service Minister David <mask> , who is the head of the national Red <mask> , told Reuters he had seen the bodies of former interior minister Christophe <mask> and his son , who was not named .
Witnesses said they had been seized by troops loyal to President Ange-Felix <mask> at dawn on Thursday when they clashed with soldiers staging a mutiny since November 16 .
Grelombe is from the Yakoma tribe to which most of the rebel soldiers belong .
The uprising began over pay demands but has turned into a campaign to topple Patasse , sparking ethnic violence and dividing the capital .
The former minister and his son had been taken from their home close to the presidential palace , which is guarded by loyalist soldiers backed by French troops based in <mask> .
The bodies were found on Thursday in an open field about two km ( one mile ) further away , said Dofora and other witnesses .
The men were seized as loyalist forces and French troops fought gunbattles with mutineers who fired rockets into the city centre .
A French-owned hotel was slightly damaged .
Yakomas are hounded in stronghold districts of Patasse 's Baya people while other tribes have fled areas in rebel hands .
Roadblocks have been erected in city districts while central <mask> , which is patrolled by French troops with tanks , is deserted .
Shops and businesses have remained shut this week .
The Franco-African summit decided to send a mission <mask> to seek ways of containing the mutiny and a threat of civil war .
Chirac said <mask> <mask> President Blaise <mask> would visit <mask> " in the coming hours " with the heads of state of <mask> , <mask> and <mask> to try and establish dialogue between authorities and rebels .
The mutiny forced Patasse to miss the summit .
His spokesman had predicted the meeting to send an assessment mission .
Patasse , who won <mask> <mask> 's first multi-party elections , refuses to resign .
Church-led meadiation attempts hit deadlock over rebel demands for his departure .
Soldiers staged mutinies in April and May , with French troops stepping in with tanks and helicopters to quell the more serious second uprising .
Patasse offered concessions and amnesty to rebels before the May rebellion ended after rebels looted the city centre .
Rebels accuse Patasse of tribalism and of arming his civilian supporters and hired guns from <mask> and <mask> .
Mutineers have vowed to disarm all civilians and to chase out the foreign forces knwon as Codos .
Hospital sources and witnesses said about 10 people were known to have been killed in the more than two weeks of fighting , including two rebels killed in Thursday 's clashes .
An undetermined number of people are reported to have been abducted and killed outside the town by tribal vigilante groups .
In Thursday 's fighting , French troops fired back as mutineers trying to break out of their strongholds rained mortar shells on the city centre .

Albanian jailed for threat of bomb suicide .
<mask> 1996-12-06
An Albanian court on Friday sentenced a man who threatened to blow himself up outside President Sali <mask> 's office to 13 years in jail for guerrilla action and illegal possession of arms .
Buza last April said he would blow himself up outside the presidential palace unless he was allowed to speak to Berisha , who was at the time meeting Italian President Oscar <mask> <mask> .
Buza was overpowered by riot police less than one hour after he began his action .
" Evaluating all the conditions of the case the court thinks the sentence should be lower than the minimum ( 15 years ) , " <mask> judge Qazim <mask> added .
The defendant denied the charges , saying his action was intended to urge the authorities to give him a $ 20,000 loan .
Medical experts had concluded Buza was mentally unstable but fully responsible for the act he had committed , Gjonaj said .
Polish ex-communist president to visit Pope .
<mask> 1996-12-06
<mask> 's ex-communist President Aleksander <mask> is likely to visit Polish-born Pope John <mask> in early 1997 despite uneasy relations between the <mask> and <mask> , the foreign minister said on Friday .
" President Kwasniewski plans to visit <mask> on a invitation from President Oscar <mask> .
A meeting with the Pope is also planned , " Dariusz <mask> told a news conference .
Rosati said that the atmosphere of the meeting , if it takes place , would largely depend on the progress in talks on ratification of a treaty between <mask> and the <mask> .
@
The ratification of the treaty , which was signed in 1993 by the then right-centrist government , is being delayed by an ex-communist party , which won parliamentary elections in the same year and now dominates parliament .
The party , the Democratic <mask> <mask> , says the agreement would give the Catholic <mask> too much influence over life in <mask> and could infringe on rights of other religious groups and non-believers .
The relations with the <mask> have also been soured by a recent relaxation of <mask> 's anti-abortion rules , which Kwasniewski signed into law last month .
<mask> warns Norilsk , not expected to liquidate it .

Russian Finance Minister Alexander <mask> warned financially-troubled Norilsk <mask> on Friday that it must pay overdue taxes , but analysts said the firm would not be liquidated or that its would assets would be frozen .
" Norilsk really is a big debtor , both to the federal and regional budgets , " said Konstantin <mask> , equities analyst at <mask> brokerage Rinaco <mask> and a Norilsk watcher . "
Livshits 's words are an attempt to put pressure on the company . "
The official Itar-Tass news agency quoted Livshits as telling parliamentary deputies that RAO <mask> <mask> 0#NKEL.RUO had to pay its tax arrears and that bankruptcy procedures applied to the metals group .
" If it was an unsolicited statement and a bolt out of the blue , then it obviously means something , " said Christopher <mask> , chief economist at United <mask> <mask> in <mask> .
" But if it was a response to a deputy 's question that was essentially loaded , then it was the only answer he could have given . "
Russian tax and cabinet authorities , under pressure from the International <mask> <mask> to boost tax revenues as a condition for receiving payments of a $ 10 billion , three-year loan to <mask> , have been striking fear into the hearts of some of <mask> 's most prominent industrial firms by saying they must pay up or face liquidation .
" They could freeze metal , but it 's not a long-term solution to the problem and would n't put money in the budget , " Chernyshev said . "
I do n't think they would do that . "
Entire social infrastructures in the icy Far North where Norilsk is based depend on the company , and <mask> has said it has no finances to resettle hundreds of thousands of people -- an expenditure which could far outstrip Norilsk 's debts .
Norilsk officials declined to comment .
Analysts said the government , while anxious about Norilsk 's debts , is highly unlikely to bring the nickel , copper , cobalt , platinum and platinum group metals producer to its knees or take measures that could significantly affect output .
But it also wants Norilsk , the world 's second-largest nickel producer , to clean up its act .
" The procedure of bankruptcy will be applied , " Tass quoted Livshits as telling Duma deputies about Norilsk .
It indirectly quoted him as saying Norilsk should first pay salary arrears , which in the past have led to worker strikes .
" It is unlikely that Norilsk will pay these debts in the near-term -- the company will remain a debtor in the near future , " Chernyshev said .
He estimated the company 's regional debts at least one trillion roubles and said 30 percent of the giant <mask> regional budget was fuelled by Norilsk money .
Norilsk 's new majority shareholder , Russian commerical bank Uneximbank , has said it is reorganising metal exports through Interrosimpex in order to boost revenues .
But the changes have yet to improve significantly Norilsk 's situation .
" Uneximbank has inherited a mountain and whether or not they climb out and over it remains to be seen , " said one metals source .
Norilsk said in September that it total debts , including unpaid salaries to workers , were 13 trillion roubles .
The company said last month that it had worked out a tax payment schedule with authorities , after regional tax officials threatened to seize some nickel and copper assets .

<mask> stocks off lows but still hit by Greenspan .
<mask> <mask>
Mexican stocks closed sharply lower Friday , but had made a tentative recovery as initial panic and volatility abated .
" It was Greenspan at first .
Then once we saw the Dow ( Jones industrial average ) was not about to crash , some buyers stepped in , " said a trader , referring to Federal <mask> Chairman Alan <mask> , whose comments that assets were " irrationally exhuberant " upset financial markets worldwide .
The blue-chip IPC index ended down 1.29 points , or 43.56 percent , at 3,333.05 .
Volume was regular at 74.7 million shares traded .
Mexican stocks were also hurt by <mask> long bond rates which had begun to rise before Greenspan 's comments and were inflated by employment data released before trade began in <mask> .
Yields on <mask> 30-year Treasury bonds were 6.51 percent when stock trading closed in <mask> , unchanged from Thursday .
On the broad market , 107 stocks changed hands , of which losers well outnumbered winners by 75 to 13 .
Traders noted the lack of blue chips or stocks traded at significant volume among the gainers .
Simec , the steelmaking arm of the debt-ridden Sidek group headed the losers , off 7 centavos ( 1 cent ) at 1.40 pesos ( 18 cents ) .
Sidek fell 4 centavos ( 1 cent ) to 95 centavos ( 12 cents ) .
Traders also remarked that Mexican ADRs suffered in <mask> <mask> .
Heavyweights Telmex and Televisa ended off 25 cents and 75 cents , respectively , at $ 31.125 and $ 25.875 .
" Falling share prices in <mask> <mask> do n't hurt <mask> as long as it happens gradually , as earlier this week .
It 's a sudden plunge that takes its toll , " said Carlos <mask> , research director at <mask> .
Traders and analysts differed as to how firm the relative recovery on Friday was .
" Some buyers stepped in , but the market was not very convinced .
Volume was lackluster , " said one trader .
" The market 's very healthy , we 're buying , " said another trader .

Plastic surgery gets boost in <mask> .

<mask> <mask> <mask> 1996-12-06
Plastic surgery is booming , especially among men , as Brazilians spend much of their new-found wealth on the latest beauty treatments , said the organisers of a four-day international plastic surgery conference that opened on Friday .
The number of plastic surgeries in <mask> has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150,000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in July 1994 , Farid <mask> , the president of the Brazilian <mask> <mask> <mask> ( SBCP ) , said .
The number of operations on men increased even more -- by 80 percent , from 8,000 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995 , he said .
" <mask> ranks right at the top for plastic surgery with respect to the number of surgeons , the number of patients , number of operations , number of conferences .
Our statistics are the highest for everything , " Hakme said .
" We believe the increase in plastic surgeries for men results from the difficulties in the job market .
People need to have a more youthful look to compete in the job market , given the profound changes in <mask> <mask> 's economy . "
A controlled exchange rate , trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation , making more money available for cosmetic surgery .
<mask> has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons , Ivo <mask> .
There are 6,000 plastic surgeons there , of which 4,500 have qualified to be members of the SBCP .
Every year , 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in <mask> and medical students from all over the world come to study there .
Hakme attributes <mask> 's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country 's mix and match of different races , which can create physical disharmonies . "
What happens is the nose sometimes does n't match the mouth or the buttocks do n't match with the legs , " he said .
<mask> 's most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body , with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each .
Stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions , but unlike women elsewhere Brazilians tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants .
" The women who want to reduce their breasts here would probably want to increase them in the <mask> <mask> , " SBCP Vice-President Oswaldo <mask> said . "
Beauty ideals and cultures are different in every country . "
Plastic surgery scares like the case in which Brazilian model Claudia <mask> fell into a coma after being anaesthetised for a liposuction in October are not much of a deterrent .
Saldanha said operations fell 30 percent immediately after that case but the rate was back to normal now .

<mask> , <mask> <mask> 1996-12-06
East <mask> Roman <mask> Bishop Carlos <mask> left <mask> on Friday on his way to <mask> for the awards ceremony as co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel <mask> <mask> .
Witnesses said Belo left the territory for the Indonesian capital <mask> accompanied by five other people .
It was not immediately known when he would arrive in <mask> .
The bishop will jointly receive the Nobel award next Tuesday with East <mask> activist Jose <mask> <mask> , who lives in self-exile in <mask> .
The Indonesian government has condemned the inclusion of Ramos <mask> in the award , and Foreign Minister Ali <mask> said on Friday that <mask> would not be represented officially at the ceremony in the Norwegian capital .
" I sincerely believe that this unfortunate choice in giving the honour to such a controversial figure as Ramos <mask> ...
will exacerbate the problem in finding a solution ( to <mask> <mask> ) , " Alatas said on Friday .
He was responding to questions at a news conference called to discuss next week 's ministerial meeting of the Organisation <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> ( OIC ) in <mask> .
Ramos <mask> has been a vocal leader of the opposition to <mask> 's rule in the territory .
Belo and Ramos <mask> were awared the prize for their efforts to secure a peaceful solution to the issue of <mask> <mask> , a former Portuguese colony which <mask> invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year .
The United <mask> has never recognised <mask> 's move .
Alatas said the government 's position on the Nobel <mask> <mask> would have been different if it had been awarded solely to Belo .
Asked if the Indonesian ambassador to <mask> would have attended the ceremony if only Belo had been involved , Alatas replied : " Probably , yes , but that is a hypothetical question . "
Alatas said on Tuesday that on his way back from <mask> , Belo would visit the <mask> to see the Pope , and would also meet German Chancellor Helmut <mask> in <mask> .
Kohl had wanted to meet Belo during the chancellor 's official visit to <mask> last month , but the bishop was too busy in <mask> <mask> to come to <mask> .

Government disperses protest with water cannons .
<mask> 1996-12-07
Burmese troops and riot police moved in to disperse a student street protest at a suburban road junction near the Ranyon <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> early on Saturday , witnesses said .
They said police and troops used water cannons from fire engines to subdue about 120 university students sitting in at the centre of the junction at about 3 a.m. before they moved in to round them up .
The students , who had staged an 11-hour protest at the junction in northern <mask> , were taken away in three vehicles .
The witnesses said some of the students were hit with batons while they were herded onto the vehicles and it was believed they were taken to the <mask> prison in suburban <mask> .
The protesting students , mostly from Rangoon <mask> , were demanding the right to organise independent unions on campuses and the release of about 80 student leaders currently in jail .
They were among 500 students who started demonstrating at the intersection on late Friday afternoon .
The protest was the second major one in five days in the capital .
Burmese students march briefly out of campus .
Vithoon <mask>
<mask> 1996-12-06
About 200 Burmese students marched briefly from troubled Yangon <mask> <mask> <mask> in northern <mask> on Friday towards the University <mask> <mask> six km ( four miles ) away , and returned to their campus , witnesses said .
Seven truckloads of armed riot police and three fire engines were on standby at one of the junctions near the institute .
There were no clashes .
" They are now back in the YIT campus , " an institute official who declined to be identified told Reuters by telephone .
One of two roads leading to the University <mask> <mask> from the institute had been closed by authorities .
But about 300 university students were still gathered outside the gates of their campus , witnesses said .
They were singing peacefully .
On Monday and Tuesday , students from the institute and the university launched protests against what they said was unfair handling by police of a brawl between some of their colleagues and restaurant owners in October .
On Tuesday and Wednesday , opposition leader Aung <mask> <mask> <mask> was restricted to her home by the military government to prevent her from being drawn into the protests .
She was allowed to move freely on Thursday .
The protest culminated at dawn on Tuesday with several hundred students being detained briefly by police in central <mask> .
The street protests were the biggest seen in the capital since the student-led pro-democracry demonstrations of September 1988 when the junta crushed the uprising .
Thousands were killed or imprisoned .
Earlier on Friday some of the students , who were held briefly by police during the protests earlier this week , said they were still dissatisfied with the military government .
They told Reuters they were unhappy that the ruling State <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> ( SLORC ) had not heeded their calls for the right to organise independent unions on campus .
" We still want government answers to our demands .
We want police punishment to be published in newspapers , " one student said .
But the students stressed their protests were non-political and they had no contact with Suu <mask> 's National <mask> <mask> <mask> ( NLD ) .
Suu <mask> , a Nobel laureate and daughter of independence hero Aung <mask> , and key NLD officials have also denied any link with the students .
But they have said both parties had a " moral link " in that they were against police brutality and injustice .
The students also demanded the government announce punishments meted out to policemen who they said had manhandled students involved in a brawl with some restaurant owners near the <mask> institute in October .
The students appealed to the government not to close the institute because of their latest demonstration .
The institute was shut for nearly two years after the 1988 uprising .
On Friday , the road leading to Suu <mask> 's lakeside residence in central <mask> remained closed by police .
Union leaders outraged by WTO snub to ILO head .
<mask> 1996-12-06
International trade union leaders on Friday expressed outrage that the head of the International <mask> <mask> ( ILO ) had been barred from speaking at next week 's WTO meeting in <mask> .
Bill <mask> , general secretary of the International <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> ( ICFTU ) , told a news conference the withdrawal of a WTO invitation to ILO director general Michel <mask> was " outrageous behaviour on the part of an organisation that wants to command respect in the world " .
Jordan said a small group of developing nations that oppose linking trade talks and labour conditions had pressured World <mask> <mask> ( WTO ) officials to prevent Hansenne from taking the platform to urge such links .
" It is to their shame that those who are responsible for encouraging this meeting responded ( to the pressure ) in silencing him , " Jordan said after the opening of an ICFTU conference on international labour standards and trade .
The three-day trade union conference in <mask> hopes to push labour issues onto the WTO agenda .
Jordan said the WTO 's credibility was at stake over the issue of trade and labour .
The ICFTU said it wanted the WTO conference beginning on Monday to outlaw forced and child labour , end discrimination in hiring , and guarantee the right to join a union .
Bill <mask> , chairman of the ILO <mask> <mask> , told Reuters before the news conference he was " not too surprised , but very disappointed " that the speaking invitation had been withdrawn .
" Some governments are very determined to stop the issue ( of trade and labour rights ) being discussed , " he said , adding that the Association <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> ( ASEAN ) seemed particularly hostile to the ILO agenda .
ASEAN groups <mask> , <mask> , <mask> , the <mask> , <mask> , <mask> and <mask> .
The ILO wants a trade and labour rights " social clause " included in the final ministerial statement issued by WTO leaders at the end of the meeting , the organization 's first ministerial-level gathering .
Speaking to ICFTU delegates , Richard <mask> , director of the WTO secretariat , said the WTO was capable of making a significant contribution to governmental efforts to solve social problems .
But he said the WTO 's organisational structure made it difficult to impose on its members a social clause such as that called for by the ILO .
Indian rubber demand seen outstripping production .
<mask> 1996-12-06
Indian rubber demand is seen outpacing local production in the 1996/97 April / March season and the trend will persist way into the next century , the chairman of the Rubber <mask> <mask> <mask> said on Friday .
K.J. <mask> said at the Asia <mask> <mask> <mask> here Indian production of natural rubber in 1996/97 will reach 547,000 tonnes against projected demand of 578,000 tonnes , a gap of 31,000 tonnes .
For synthetic rubber , production reached 68,200 tonnes in 1995/96 while consumption in the same season hit 134,085 tonnes , Matthew added .
" Though schemes designed to realise further increases in the production of natural rubber are being operated successfully , the demand-supply gap is expected to widen , " he said .
Indian synthetic rubber output is not expected to rise significantly in the next season but demand will rise to 145,000 tonnes .
Matthew estimates that by the 2000/01 season , the gap between natural rubber output and consumption will rise to 51,000 tonnes and 319,000 tonnes in 2010/11 .
Natural rubber production will go up to 695,000 tonnes in 2000/01 against consumption of 746,000 tonnes .
In 2010/11 , domestic demand should rise further to 1.233 million tonnes while production will only reach about 914,000 tonnes .
One way to bridge the widening gap is to put more land under cultivation which the Rubber <mask> official estimates will reach 220,000 hectares between now and the year 2003 although Matthew said this may not be possible at this time in <mask> .
" The development objective for the rubber plantation industry will be to increase production to the best extent possibly with a view to minimising imports of natural rubber , " he said .

<mask> 's authorities seen seeking to rein in dollar .
George <mask>
<mask> 1996-12-06
Comments by <mask> 's tight-lipped central bank chief and an influential top bureaucrat are further signs that the nation 's authorities want to keep the dollar at current levels , market sources said on Friday .
In a rare expression of a view on currencies by the Bank <mask> <mask> ( BOJ ) governor , Yasuo <mask> was quoted in <mask> 's leading economic daily on Friday as saying that he sees no further , immediate fall in the yen .
This followed a widely watched television appearance late on Thursday by Eisuke <mask> , a high-ranking Finance <mask> official , who denied he had said he wants to guide the dollar lower to between 108 and 110 yen .
But many in the market thought Sakakibara 's real intentions lay elsewhere , and took more notice of his comments about the <mask> government 's stance on the dollar , dealers said .
" I think his views on ( U.S. <mask> Secretary Robert ) Rubin 's comments were indeed what he himself thinks about the dollar , " said Hank <mask> , chief dealer at Sumitomo <mask> .
Asked about Rubin 's comment that a strong dollar was in <mask> interests , Sakakibara said the remark does not necessarily mean the <mask> <mask> supports a stronger dollar .
" It 's a strong dollar , not stronger .
In that sense , the comments are not pointing to a certain direction , " he said .
" It shows that Sakakibara is not for a stronger dollar either , " said Sumitomo 's Note .
Takao <mask> , first vice president at Union <mask> <mask> <mask> in <mask> , said : " Maybe a dollar at 104.50 yen is not acceptable ( to Sakakibara ) , but it may be okay at the current level , at the lower end of 112 yen . "
Market participants have kept a close eye on Sakakibara , chief of the ministry 's International <mask> <mask> , as a comment he made in November after the dollar hit this year 's high of 114.92 yen pushed the currency down sharply .
He had said then that the market 's view on <mask> 's economy was too pessimistic and that he believed it was stronger than the market thought .
Dealers have come to refer to 115 yen as the " Sakakibara ceiling " for the dollar following the remark .
Adding to the comments by " Mr <mask> " , as Sakakibara is known for his prominence in the currency market , was BOJ governor Matsushita 's remark .
" The recent level of the yen exchange rate has been stable , and it does not appear to be moving towards a further depreciation of the yen immediately , so import prices are likely to stabilise at current levels , " Matsushita said in an interview with the Nihon <mask> <mask> .
" The fact that he touched on the issue of inflation triggered by import prices shows that the BOJ does not want a further depreciation of the yen , past 115 yen , " said Yasuhito <mask> , chief forex manager at Toyo <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> .
Some said the central bank may have been concerned a weaker yen would lead to unfounded pessimism about <mask> 's economy .
" There was concern that foreign investors may sell Japanese stocks if the dollar goes above 115 yen .
The BOJ does not want the yen 's weakness to lead to pessimism over the economy , " said Taisuke <mask> , market strategist with Credit <mask> in <mask> .
Senior BOJ officials have separately said financial markets ' views on the economy have been too negative .
" I realise there are negative views in the markets about the impact of the consumption tax hike and drop in public spending , but the markets appear to be exaggerating the magnitude of the negative impact , " a senior BOJ official told Reuters on Friday .
The consumption tax is due to raised in April from three to five percent .
<mask> sentences pro-Israeli warlord to death .
Haitham <mask>
<mask> 1996-12-06
A Lebanese military court on Friday sentenced to death in absentia the commander of <mask> 's surrogate militia in south <mask> on treason charges .
The court convicted General Antoine <mask> , head of the South <mask> <mask> ( SLA ) , of collaborating with <mask> with which <mask> is officially at war .
Lahd , a 69-year-old former Lebanese army major-general , heads the 3,000-strong SLA militia which helps <mask> hold a border zone in south <mask> to ward off cross-frontier guerrilla raids on northern <mask> .
Lahd said a few days after the trial began on February 16 that Lebanese authorities must drop the charges or risk blocking any peace deal with the Jewish state .
He said <mask> was capable of pressuring <mask> 's Syrian-backed government to stop the legal pursuit .
The charges against Lahd were : forming a hostile army , carrying weapons on <mask> 's side , helping <mask> strip off a part of Lebanese territory by violence , forming an armed gang , killing or trying to kill Lebanese civilians by artillery shelling and kidnapping Lebanese citizens for long periods .
Shortly before Lahd 's trial began , a <mask> military prosecutor charged another 89 former Lebanese army soldiers with collaborating with <mask> .
No date has been set for the trial of the men , all members of the SLA living in the Israeli-held zone in south <mask> .
<mask> and Lahd have repeatedly demanded safety guarantees for the SLA -- a mixed Christian-Shi'ite Moslem force -- which the Jewish states regards as loyal allies .
<mask> has said the Lebanese army must incorporate the SLA fighters into its ranks as an army brigade as a condition for peace .
But Lebanese political analysts have said that would be out of the question and Lebanese authorities pre-empted the issue by taking legal action against Lahd .
Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon <mask> , calling Lahd " a great Lebanese patriot " , said earlier this year <mask> had insulted the SLA commander by ordering his arrest on the treason charges .
Peres , who was ousted in May by rightwing Israeli leader Benjamin <mask> , said there could not be real negotiations with <mask> " unless it will stop the maltreatment of the SLA and its commanders . "
The <mask> military court also sentenced to life in jail in absentia Etian <mask> , former head of the pro-Israeli Guardians <mask> <mask> <mask> , a small rightwing Christian civil war militia .
Saqr , whose trial was concurrent with Lahd 's , was convicted of " contacting the Israeli enemy , passing information to <mask> and undertaking hostile acts against <mask> " .

14 years later , <mask> man dies for killing .
<mask> , <mask> 1996-12-06
Fourteen years after he bludgeoned and shot a man whose trailer home he robbed in 1982 , John <mask> Jr .
, 41 , was put to death in <mask> 's electric chair Friday .
As Glenn <mask> , a rural <mask> minister who is the victim 's father , looked on , Mills was pronounced dead at 7:13 a.m. EST ( 1213 GMT ) for the murder of Lester <mask> .
Speaking in Arabic , Mills made a final statement before an anonymous citizen flipped the switch that sent 2000 volts of electricity through his body , said Department <mask> <mask> spokesman Eugene <mask> , who was present at the execution .
" I bear witness that there is no God but Allah and I bear witness that the prophet Mohammed is the messenger of God , " he quoted Mills as saying .
Prison officials said they had no record of Mills ' official conversion , but they said that , on May 14 , 1991 , he had asked that a new name , Yuhanna <mask> <mask> , be added to his prison file , which is usually an indication of a conversion to Islam .
Mills is the 38th person to die in <mask> 's electric chair since the U.S. <mask> <mask> reversed itself in 1976 and legalised the death penalty .
Prison officials said Mills made no special request for a last meal and did not eat the steak , fried potatoes and orange juice offered him .
He spent Thursday with family members and his spiritual adviser , Morris said .
Mills was scheduled to die Wednesday but had his sentence temporarily postponed by the Florida <mask> <mask> .
On Thursday , the 11th Circuit U.S. <mask> <mask> <mask> in <mask> denied his appeal in federal court .
In March 1982 , Mills and accomplice Michael <mask> knocked on the door of Lester <mask> 's trailer in an attempt to rob it , police said .
Lester <mask> was taken to a nearby airstrip where he was bludgeoned with a tire iron .
Mills then fired two shots that killed Lawhon as the victim tried to run away .

1996-12-06
A farmhand used the proceeds from stolen pigs to lavish tips on dancers at strip clubs and offered one $ 3,000 to pay for breast implant surgery , authorities said Friday .
In sentencing Darrel <mask> , 38 , to a 10-year prison term on Thursday , <mask> <mask> Circuit Court Judge Dennis <mask> said he was " a thief by habit . "
" You are self-indulgent .
You are narcissitic , " Luebke said at the sentencing , adding Voeks should pay restitution of more than $ 100,000 to the farming family who had hired him .
Voeks , who was already on probation for prior pig thefts , pleaded that he was trying to pay bills for his ex-wife and children .
But the court heard that receipts showed much of the money went to dancers at strip clubs where he was known as a big tipper .
One stripper said Voeks offered to give her $ 3,000 for breast implant surgery .

Half of dog bites provoked , says American vet .
<mask> 1996-12-06
As many as 1 million dog bites are recorded in the <mask> <mask> every year and half of them are provoked by humans , a veterinarian told fellow animal doctors on Friday .
The Humane Society of the <mask> <mask> estimates that between 500,000 and one million bites are delivered by dogs each year , more than half of which are suffered by children .
" Most bites can be prevented by teaching children how to respect a dog , " Michael <mask> of the Glencoe <mask> <mask> in <mask> , <mask> , told the annual meeting of the American <mask> <mask> <mask> .
" Let 's not let our kids jump on them or crawl on them .
Dogs and children do n't have to have an interaction .
Let 's respect their territories , " he said .
Cornwell said 50 percent of reported bites were provoked by a person and 60 percent were suffered by children .
He also estimated that only 25 percent of bites were reported because medical attention was not needed .
Don <mask> , president of the National <mask> <mask> <mask> , said aggressiveness in dogs was related more to gender than breed and a male dog that had not been neutered was three times more likely to bite than an unspayed female .
The five breeds credited with the most incidents were chow chows , Rottweilers , German <mask> , cocker <mask> and Dalmatians . "
The trends in dog bites by particular breeds have more to do with fad pets owned by individuals who need to have something unique .
Speaking strictly of dogs , 15 years ago the macho fad pet was a Doberman .
Today , Rottweilers are on the way up , " Rieck said .
If approached by a stray dog , children should be taught to stand still with fists folded underneath the neck , elbows in , and gaze forward until the dog goes away .

UNITED <mask> 1996-12-06
Four African states are ready to nominate candidates for the post of U.N. secretary-general on Friday now that Boutros <mask> has temporarily put aside his bid for re-election .

Diplomats said General Joseph <mask> of <mask> , a U.N. <mask> <mask> president in 1989-90 , was putting forth his own candidacy without being nominated by his country .
Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday opened the door for other Africans to contest his job by saying he was suspending temporarily his candidacy but was not withdrawing completely from the race .
His supporters said this meant he remained a candidate in case the race reached an impasse .
The <mask> <mask> on Nov. 19 vetoed his bid for re-election while the other 14 Security <mask> members supported him .
The move by the African states means that the council could begin voting on candidates next week , a procedure that could either result in a decision or turn into a bitter fight with vetoes against each nominee .
The Security <mask> has to vote on a new secretary-general and then seek the endorsement of the 185-members General <mask> before December 31 when Boutros-Ghali 's term expires .

Indian officials blame revenge-minded Moslem underworld gangs in <mask> for a string of bombings in the city three months later that killed 260 people .
The BJP backs a hardline Hindu campaign to build a temple at the site of the mosque , which Hindus believe was the birthplace of the Lord Rama .
The campaign catapulted BJP from the political fringe to become <mask> 's main opposition party in 1991 .

<mask> , <mask> 1996-12-06
Two people were killed when an executive jet en route to <mask> from <mask> crashed on approach to an airport in <mask> , <mask> , on Friday , authorities said .

PLO says Arafat , Netanyahu could meet Saturday .
<mask> 1996-12-06
PLO negotiators said on Friday Palestinian President Yasser <mask> , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin <mask> and Egyptian President Hosni <mask> might all meet on Saturday to try to clinch a deal on <mask> 's handover of <mask> to the PLO .
" It is very possible that Arafat and Netanyahu will meet in <mask> on Saturday .
There is work on arranging such a meeting hosted by President Mubarak , " one PLO official , who requested anonymity , told Reuters .
Israeli officials said no meeting had yet been set .
Arafat 's adviser Nabil <mask> <mask> said :
" President Arafat is ready to meet Prime Minister Netanyahu but no time or date has been set for such a meeting yet .
" President Arafat 's position is clear that such a meeting should come after successful negotiations so that the meeting would have positive results .
Especially since the <mask> issue has not been agreed yet and the crucial disputed issues have not been resolved . "
But Rdainah said Arafat would go to <mask> on Saturday for talks with Mubarak .
Both Arafat and Netanyahu have expressed willingness to meet .
They last met in <mask> after clashes in September that killed 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis .
The violence was spurred by <mask> 's opening an entrance to a tunnel near Moslem sites in <mask> .
The Palestine <mask> <mask> ( PLO ) negotiators said the last two weeks of talks with <mask> on implementing the long-delayed handover of most of <mask> to PLO rule had been " meaningless " , necessitating an Arafat-Netanyahu meeting .
Mubarak 's adviser Osama <mask> said on Thursday there were efforts to arrange a meeting between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders .
Palestinian <mask> Secretary General Ahmed <mask> said on Thursday he understood it could be held in <mask> either on Friday or Sunday .
Abdel-Rahman had said on Thursday he did not think Saturday would be the date because it is the Jewish sabbath .
But the Jewish sabbath ends at sundown , so a night meeting would not interfere with the religious observance .
<mask> hindered by own landmines on Syrian border .
<mask> 1996-12-06
<mask> 's efforts to prevent Kurdish rebels and smugglers infiltrating from <mask> are being badly hindered because the military does not have a map of its own minefields on the border , a commission of parliamentarians said .
" It is not known exactly where the mines have been sown because a minefield chart cannot be found , " the commission said in a report on border protection .
The report , to be debated in parliament in coming weeks , was seen by Reuters on Friday . "
Officials say the minefields present an obstacle to the security forces , " it said .
It said Kurdistan <mask> <mask> ( PKK ) guerrillas sometimes know the layout of mined areas along the border better than the security forces .
" Terrorists and smugglers have dug up the mines , defused them and opened up wide paths in some areas .
They can come in and out easily as the minefields are not an obstacle , " it said .
An armed forces spokesman was not available for comment .
<mask> says <mask> sponsors the PKK , fighting for Kurdish self-rule in southeast <mask> .
<mask> denies aiding the rebels .
The PKK also crosses into <mask> from bases in the mountains of northern <mask> .

Three dead in Kurd militia blood feud in <mask> .
<mask> , <mask> 1996-12-06
Three people were killed on Friday in a gun battle between rival groups of anti-guerrilla militiamen on the streets of this southeastern Turkish city , police said .
Four others were wounded in the clash , caused by a blood feud between two families , the Kesers and Karabuluts , serving as state-paid village guards against Kurdish rebels .
Police said the guards fired automatic weapons at each other .
One of the dead was a civilian passer-by .
The role of the 70,000 mainly Kurdish village guards who fight Kurdistan <mask> <mask> ( PKK ) guerrillas in the southeast has been questioned recently after media allegations that many of them are involved in common crime .
The head of the region 's main pro-state militia is at the centre of a security scandal that has shaken the government .
More than 21,000 people have been killed in the 12-year-old conflict between Turkish security forces and the PKK , fighting for Kurdish autonomy or independence .

<mask> blasts release of convicted bomber .
<mask> 1996-12-05
The <mask> <mask> Thursday blasted the release from a Greek prison of a Palestinian guerrilla convicted of bombing an airliner and killing a teenager in 1982 , saying the move " does not make sense . "
" All of us who have been victimised by terrorists ... need to stand together against terrorists .
We ca n't let terrorists out of jail when they are a danger to civilians all around the world , " State <mask> spokesman Nicholas <mask> said . '
Mohammed <mask> " is a terrorist who deserves to be behind bars .
It is inexplicable to us why he would have been allowed to leave <mask> before serving his just sentence ... This is an incomprehensible move .
It does not make sense , " Burns told a news briefing .
He spoke after Rashid left <mask> Thursday on being freed from prison early for good behaviour after serving 8-1/2 years .
The Clinton administration 's strong views on this subject have been conveyed to the Greek government , Burns said .
Mahammad <mask> was whisked from <mask> maximum security prison just outside <mask> to the airport where he boarded a regular Olympic <mask> flight to <mask> where he would transit to <mask> and the former Palestine <mask> <mask> headquarters .
Rashid , 46 , was sentenced to 18 years in prison by a Greek court in 1992 after being convicted of premeditated murder in the mid-air bombing of a Pan <mask> airliner in 1982 .
His sentence had been reduced to 15 years in 1993 .
A parole court ruled recently that Rashid could be freed after serving 8-1/2 years , with time in pre-trial detention counted towards his term , but said he must be expelled immediately from <mask> .
The <mask> <mask> accuses Rashid of belonging to the May 15 Palestinian guerrilla group and being an accomplished student of master Palestinian bombmaker Abu <mask> .
Three FBI agents who testified against Rashid during the trial , held at <mask> prison , said they had ample evidence against Rashid for a bomb planted on a Pan <mask> plane in <mask> in 1982 and a mid-air bomb blast on a TWA airliner approaching <mask> in 1986 which killed four <mask> citizens .
School football player banned for slashing opponents .
<mask> , <mask> 1996-12-05
A <mask> <mask> high school football player who used razor-sharp helmet buckles to slash opponents and a referee was expelled from high school banned Thursday from competition for one year .
Mike <mask> , 17 , was expelled from St <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> in <mask> after an October game in which he used the sharpened chin strap buckles to injure two opposing players and the referee .
One of the players need 10 stitches to a cut on his forearm .
Officials said the New <mask> <mask> <mask> decided to bar Cito from any inter-scholastic competition until next October , regardless of the school he attends .
Cito 's father , Stephen <mask> , had admitted filing the metal buckles to a fine edge , saying he did it to get even with the referee and with players who had roughed up his son in a previous game .
Cyberspace squabbles overshadow copyright talks .
Elif <mask>
<mask> 1996-12-06
In a gloomy <mask> conference centre built before the dawn of the Internet , groups of staid officials made a first stab on Friday at rewriting copyright laws for the digital age .
But critics at the first government-level meeting to revise copyright laws in 25 years said the officials and legislators might as well be trying to police the ether .
After four days of diplomatic wrangling over procedures , some 600 delegates from nations small and large got down to the nitty-gritty of setting the digital agenda for the first time .
Cyberspace squabbles overshadowed the debate on a stack of proposals covering literary and artistic works , the rights of performers and producers of music and producers of databases .
" If it goes on like this , we wo n't have enough time to finish all the discussions , " a frustrated Western delegate said . "
They announced they will start evening sessions next week . "
Attempts by copyright-based industries to ensure they get a cut from online works led to a storm of protests by Internet companies and critics who say the pacts would curb public access to online information from soccer results to stock prices .
" It 's not illegal to make photocopies of newspaper articles .
It 's fair use .
We can read sports statistics or stock prices .
But with the treaty , this kind of fact will be owned and subject to licensing , " said James <mask> , a consumer lobbyist heading the Washington-based Consumer <mask> on Technology .
" None of the treaties are ready to move .
These people do n't understand what they 're doing . "
At stake are billions of dollars and the future of the electronic information industry -- the coming medium for the distribution of music , films , literature , software and commerce .
Supporters of the three pacts say they are only an extension of existing intellectual property rights , covered by the century-old Berne <mask> .
But an array of opponents from the network industry to consumer , scientific and academic groups say the pacts will give sweeping powers to entertainment and copyright-based industries .
A quick survey at the conference centre found few officials who had actually surfed the Internet .
<mask> 's state copyright official , Gundegma <mask> , said apologetically that he had just arrived from <mask> <mask> and was not aware of the details of the digital agenda .
" We do n't have money for Internet in <mask> , " he added .
Alexander <mask> , deputy legal chief at <mask> 's foreign ministry , said <mask> had yet to formulate a policy on copyright in cybersppace .
He too had never browsed the Net .
" I 've never tried it and why should I ?
There are lots of other things in this life I have n't tried either , " he said .
A visit to the computer centre offering Internet services found a lone European official clicking away on his mouse .
" Internet is a potential cash cow for copyright-based industries and we need roadmaps on the information superhighway , " said Marc <mask> , vice-president of the Information <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> , a trade association of <mask> network companies opposing the treaties .
" But there are a lot of dinosaurs here .
People here do n't understand Internet technology .
Because they do n't understand technology , they fear the unknown . "
Before the Internet , those whose business was to protect copyrights knew where they stood .
Their enemies were tangible if elusive , such as the people who pirated music cassettes .
But the Internet , a global computer network where anything from music to software can be duplicated and distributed at the click of a computer mouse , has ripped up the rulebooks .
Network operators said the draft laws would hold them responsible for copyright infringements in the system and expose them to multi-billion-dollar liabilities .
" There are 500 million messages transmitted through the Internet everyday , " said Tim <mask> of the U.S.-based MCI <mask> <mask> . "
How can we control them all ? "

<mask> 1996-12-06

Third <mask> blast victim was Moroccan student .
<mask> 1996-12-06
Moroccan Mohamed <mask> , the third person to die after a bombing on a <mask> train , was a 25-year-old student about to submit a mathematics doctorate , the Moroccan embassy said on Friday .
Benchaou died of his injuries on Thursday night , two days after the blast .
A newly-married Canadian woman and a man from <mask> <mask> died instantly in the bomb that injured 90 others in the rush-hour train .
An embassy spokesman said Benchaou , the son of a Moroccan army colonel , had been due to take his doctorate in March and hoped to become a teacher .
Investigators have said the explosion bore the hallmarks of Algerian Moslem fundamentalists who staged a series of bombings last year which killed eight people and injured more than 160 .
Italian President urges separatists to turn back .
MANTUA , <mask> 1996-12-06
Italian President Oscar <mask> <mask> visited the symbolic heartland of the separatist Northern <mask> on Friday and appealed to its supporters to drop their campaign for a breakaway state .
Addressing a convention on Italian unity in Mantua , where the party has set up its own " parliament of the north " , Scalfaro made a direct appeal to what he called " my friends from the League " to work instead for federal reform .
" It is an invitation , a commitment , a promise .
<mask> 's march together , " Scalfaro , a northerner himself , said .
" Help <mask> to teach , to propose a capacity for strong local autonomy , for the federalism which can give new vigour to our blood .
But turn back from the line you are taking now , " he said .
Scalfaro was in <mask> to attend a ceremony commemorating the executions there by Austrian rulers in 1852 and 1853 of a group of Italians who had campaigned for national unity .
He was jeered and whistled at by a small group of <mask> supporters when he arrived for a visit marked by heavy security .
Witnesses said the protesters were outnumbered by other Italians who waved tricolour flags in the national red , white and green or shouted " Viva <mask> " .
The League won more than eight percent of votes at the last general election in April on a federalist platform but its leader Umberto <mask> later switched to a separatist agenda .
A three-day " independence " march along the <mask> River in September , culminating in a declaration in <mask> of a self-styled " <mask> <mask> <mask> " , flopped badly .

British " Euro-sceptic " says Clarke should resign .
<mask> 1996-12-06
A " Euro-sceptic " member of the ruling Conservative party said on Thursday British finance minister Kenneth <mask> had to resign to prevent the party disintegrating over the issue of a single European currency .
Member of Parliament Tony <mask> said the resignation of the chancellor of the exchequer was the only way to make the Conservatives electable in a general election which must take place by May next year .
" We have a divided and split Cabinet .
This cannot endure , " Marlow told BBC television 's Newsnight programme on Thursday . "
It is not sustainable .
Kenneth <mask> has to go .
If he does n't resign , the prime minister has got to fire him . "
Marlow 's comment come on the heels of speculation that Clarke had threatened to resign if the government changed its " wait and see " policy on a single currency and declared it would not sign up for the currency in the next Parliament .
Clarke denied on Thursday he had threatened to resign and said his position on the single currency was in tune with that of Prime Minister John <mask> .
Major told parliament on Thursday he would keep his options open on single-currency membership .
His statement was interpreted as a significant victory for Clarke and fellow pro-European Michael <mask> , deputy prime minister .
Pro-European Conservative MP Edwina <mask> told the BBC that if Clarke resigned , other ministers would go with him .
Court ejects head of Australian child-sex inquiry .
<mask> 1996-12-06
The Australian opposition on Friday demanded a high-powered investigation into paedophilia in the Australian diplomatic service after the federal court forced the head of the existing inquiry to stand aside .
The court said inquiry head Chris <mask> might be biased , since he privately told a newspaper he had turned up no major evidence of paedophile activity , even though he still had months ' of investigation before him .
" Today we are left with a ruinous wreck beyond salvage and a continuing pall of doubt and suspicion hanging over our diplomatic service , " opposition foreign affairs spokesman Laurie <mask> said .
But the government responded by pressing ahead with the original inquiry , established in May , appointing a new head to lead it .
Critics say that if there were many paedophiles in senior posts in the Foreign <mask> <mask> then a secret inquiry would be open to internal influence and would become a public service whitewash .
Accordingly , they demand an open investigation .
A spokesman for Foreign <mask> Minister Alexander <mask> said the appointment of a new inquiry head , administrative law expert Pamela <mask> , showed the government 's commitment to pursue the matter .
A report is due in May next year .

Australian hitman killed wrong victim .
<mask> 1996-12-06
An Australian hitman who went to the wrong house and killed the wrong man was sentenced to 20 years jail on Friday .
Paul <mask> , 33 , and an accomplice were contracted to shoot a man , identified only as Tony , in the leg to punish him for his misconduct with a female friend of the contractor , the New <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> was told .
But in February 1993 Leszic <mask> , was shot and killed after answering a knock at the door of his <mask> home . "
The inference from all the material is that the marauders had come to the wrong house , " Judge Michael <mask> said .
In sentencing Crofts , who pleaded guilty , Grove took into account his " mildly retarded " intellectual state , which placed him in the lowest two percent of the population .
Grove said Betcher was " not only the victim of a horrendous crime , but his death was brought about in circumstances of an equally ghastly error on the part of the prisoner and his accomplices " .
The unnamed accomplice was earlier sentenced to 20 years in prison .

<mask> <mask>
<mask> 1996-12-06
<mask> 's Bre-X <mask> <mask> and Barrick <mask> <mask> are to continue negotiations to hammer out a partnership agreement to develop the spectacular <mask> gold find in <mask> , sources close to the talks said on Friday .
" The negotiations will be held both in <mask> and in <mask> , " one source , speaking on condition of anonymity , told Reuters .
Another source said most of the key negotiators from both Bre-X and Barrick had returned to <mask> , but declined to say if there had been any progress in their negotiations .
Both sources said Bre-X and Barrick did not hold talks on Thursday with Mines <mask> <mask> <mask> Secretary-General Umar <mask> , who is coordinating the negotiations over the <mask> find in <mask> <mask> .
The first source also said Bre-X had until December 21 to submit to the Indonesian <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> a feasibility study on the central region of the <mask> property , estimated to contain 2.6 million ounces of gold .
The richest parts of the property to the north and south of the central region have been estimated by Bre-X to contain 57 million ounces of gold .
" Bre-X is expected to complete the feasibility report by December 16 and submit it to the government before the December 21 deadline , " the source said .
He said Bre-X would then formally seek the permission of the Indonesian government to begin construction to develop <mask> 's central region , which might take up to two years .
The source declined to say if there had been any progress in the talks between Bre-X and Barrick .
" This is a huge project ...
we are not selling furniture , and Bre-X has 13,000 shareholders to answer to , " the source said .
" While there has been some agreement in principle on some issues , there are still others such as procedures and mechanisms that needed to be sorted out , " he added .
The source said no new deadline had been set by the Mines <mask> <mask> <mask> for Bre-X and Barrick to strike a deal .
The Ministry had given the companies until December 4 to complete a partnership deal , and advised Bre-X to take a 25 percent stake and Barrick 75 percent to develop the property .
" As far as I am aware , there 's been no new deadline , " the source said .
The Ministry 's Umar said on Thursday that both Bre-X and Barrick had responded positively to a government letter recommending a 25-75 split in the Busang gold property .
The government also wants 10 percent of the property .
Umar said the government had yet to receive a formal reply from the companies .
He had said earlier that if the two companies failed to reach a partnership agreement , the government would explore other ways to expedite development of the Busang find .
Bre-X has a partnership deal with PT <mask> <mask> of the Panutan <mask> run by President Suharto 's eldest son , Sigit <mask> , under which Panutan would receive $ 40 million over 40 months plus a 10 percent stake Busang 's richest parts .
Barrick has teamed up with a construction company in the Citra <mask> of Suharto 's eldest daughter , Siti <mask> <mask> , in what Barrick had said was a partnership " to prepare us for a potential mining development project " .

The city-state met <mask> opposition two years ago in its bid to host the meeting , expected to gather 4,000 officials from 160 countries from December 9 to 13 .
In a stand some analysts linked to controversy over <mask> 's caning of an American teenager for vandalism , then-U.S. Trade Representative Mickey <mask> had said the meeting ought to be held where the WTO was going to be headquartered .
That would have meant <mask> .
But <mask> had the support of other WTO members .
Derek <mask> <mask> , senior fellow at the Institute <mask> <mask> <mask> ( ISEAS ) , said <mask> 's hosting of the conference " carries a great deal of symbolism for the city-state , underscoring its commitment to free trade and its trading links across the globe . "
There is the international prestige <mask> would enjoy , but " more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market " , said Tan <mask> <mask> , head of Business Policy at the National <mask> <mask> <mask> .
At the ministerial meeting , trade ministers will review the work of the WTO and the implementation of the <mask> Round free trade commitments under its predecessor the General <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> ( GATT ) .
In June , the WTO hailed <mask> for its open market policies but the European <mask> and other trading powers called on <mask> to speed up the opening of its services sector .
Supple said the struggle that <mask> had to wage in vying to host the meeting would be repeated during the talks .
" There is tension at every step of the way , " since a battle line between the West and developing countries has been drawn over the issue of linking trade liberalisation with labour rights , he said .
Supple said hosting the meeting carried prestige for <mask> , " however , this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region . "
From a commercial point of view , the meeting would be good for <mask> 's tourism industry , Tan said .
A large part of <mask> 's workforce would be mobilised to ensure the meeting would run without a glitch but the average Singaporean " would probably not be too concerned about some of the issues , " Tan said .
" But the more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for <mask> as a small economy . "
Supple said any political gains the <mask> government would get from the WTO meeting -- ahead of a general election due by April 1997 -- would depend on how successful it was in pushing its economic agenda .
" If there are any movements toward freer trade , then <mask> 's economy and the electorate would gain , " he said . "
But I do n't think it would be wise to play up the political aspect of this .
I think political issues will take secondary importance to all these economic issues that will be displayed . "
<mask> NTT says hopes to start int'l business soon .
<mask> 1996-12-06
Nippon <mask> <mask> <mask> <mask> ( NTT ) said on Friday that it hopes to move into the international telecommunications business as soon as possible following the government 's decision to split NTT into three firms under a holding company .
" We hope to start international telephone business as soon as possible , " a company official told Reuters .
The official said the latest government decision to split the company under a holding company would allow flexibility in NTT 's international phone business .
Earlier , Posts and Telecommunications Minister Hisao <mask> told a news conference the government plans to split NTT into three firms under a holding company , but did not specify when the restructuring would likely take effect .
One of the three new companies will be a long-distance operator and the other two will be local-call operators , Horinouchi said .
One of the local firms will operate in west <mask> and the other in east <mask> , he added .
The long-distance operator will offer international services , Horinouchi said .
The NTT official said the timing of the planned split-up was uncertain because more discussions by government officials were required .

ALPINE SKIING-OFFICIALS HOPE TO SALVAGE WORLD <mask> WEEKEND .
<mask> , <mask> <mask> 1996-12-06
World <mask> ski officials hope to be able to get in at least one men 's downhill training run on Saturday in an effort to salvage the weekend racing programme .
For the third consecutive day , Friday 's scheduled training runs were cancelled due to heavy wet snow and fog on <mask> <mask> , leaving the scheduled World <mask> events in jeopardy .
Rules call for at least one training run to be completed before a World <mask> downhill race can be staged .
Organisers hope to get that run in on Saturday morning , conditions permitting , and stage the race later in the day or on Sunday .
" There was no possibility today to make a training run , " said Bernd <mask> , the Canadian men 's national coach , citing too much new snow and poor visibility .
If organisers are forced to run the downhill on Sunday , the super-giant slalom originally scheduled for Sunday would likely be abandoned .

RUGBY <mask> - RETIRING CAMPESE WEIGHS UP OPTIONS .
<mask> 1996-12-07
David <mask> will consider offers to play club rugby in <mask> but looks more likely to spend the next year chasing business opportunities in <mask> .
The 34-year-old winger played his final game in a Wallaby jersey on Saturday but is currently a target for clubs eager to match <mask> side Saracens who have already snapped up Francois <mask> , Michael <mask> and Philippe <mask> .
" If the opportunity is there I 'd obviously think about it but the thing that holds me back is business , " said Campese .
" I 'd like to come over but there are a lot of things happening at home .
I 've also got a contract to play for New <mask> <mask> in the Super 12 next year . "
Former Wallaby captain Nick <mask> believes Campese may yet be tempted to <mask> .
" I 'm sure there are a few people in <mask> who 'd be delighted to have David <mask> in their club 's jersey , " he said .
